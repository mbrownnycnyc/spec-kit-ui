## üìã SDD Methodology Overview

Spec-Driven Development (SDD) inverts the traditional software development workflow by making specifications the primary artifact and code the generated output. The methodology consists of:

### Core Principles
- **Specifications as the Lingua Franca**: Specifications are the primary artifact
- **Executable Specifications**: Precise, complete, and unambiguous requirements
- **Continuous Refinement**: Ongoing validation and improvement
- **Research-Driven Context**: Informed technical decision-making
- **Bidirectional Feedback**: Production insights inform future specifications

### Key Commands
- **`/specify`**: Create comprehensive feature specifications
- **`/plan`**: Generate detailed implementation plans
- **`/tasks`**: Create executable task lists

### Constitutional Compliance
The methodology is governed by a nine-article constitution ensuring:
- Library-First development
- CLI interface accessibility
- Test-First implementation
- Simplicity and anti-abstraction principles
- Integration-first testing
