Hi, it's me again talking about SpecKit

00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:02,720
Hi, it's me again talking about SpecKit
 

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,390
Hi, it's me again talking about SpecKit
and I'm going to be addressing one of

4
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,400
and I'm going to be addressing one of
 

5
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,910
and I'm going to be addressing one of
the biggest requests from the community

6
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:05,920
the biggest requests from the community
 

7
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,909
the biggest requests from the community
and that is how do I use SpeckKit with

8
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:07,919
and that is how do I use SpeckKit with
 

9
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,070
and that is how do I use SpeckKit with
existing projects? Well, you're in luck

10
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080
existing projects? Well, you're in luck
 

11
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,070
existing projects? Well, you're in luck
because today is the day we're going to

12
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,080
because today is the day we're going to
 

13
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,350
because today is the day we're going to
learn how to do this and we're going to

14
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,360
learn how to do this and we're going to
 

15
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,669
learn how to do this and we're going to
learn this selfishly on my blog because

16
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:15,679
learn this selfishly on my blog because
 

17
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,349
learn this selfishly on my blog because
my blog is an existing project. I

18
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:17,359
my blog is an existing project. I
 

19
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,830
my blog is an existing project. I
maintain it for close to a decade and

20
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
maintain it for close to a decade and
 

21
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,070
maintain it for close to a decade and
this or statically close to a decade

22
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
this or statically close to a decade
 

23
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,990
this or statically close to a decade
because if we look at the reality I've

24
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
because if we look at the reality I've
 

25
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,910
because if we look at the reality I've
been writing on my blog for about I want

26
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
been writing on my blog for about I want
 

27
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,750
been writing on my blog for about I want
to say 15 years. So I have my blog repo.

28
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:29,760
to say 15 years. So I have my blog repo.
 

29
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,589
to say 15 years. So I have my blog repo.
It's a static site that's built with

00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
It's a static site that's built with
 

31
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,549
It's a static site that's built with
Hugo. It has no other frameworks. It

32
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
Hugo. It has no other frameworks. It
 

33
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,229
Hugo. It has no other frameworks. It
uses Tailwind CSS for a bunch of

00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:36,239
uses Tailwind CSS for a bunch of
 

35
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,150
uses Tailwind CSS for a bunch of
styling. It is actually Congo mod, a

styling. It is actually Congo mod, a
 

37
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,869

modified version of that theme as my

00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
modified version of that theme as my
 

39
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,310
modified version of that theme as my
core theme because if we go to den.dev,

40
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
core theme because if we go to den.dev,
 

41
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,150
core theme because if we go to den.dev,
that's that that's what it is. You'll

42
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160
that's that that's what it is. You'll
 

43
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,229
that's that that's what it is. You'll
see this beautiful website that I

44
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
see this beautiful website that I
 

45
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,150
see this beautiful website that I
absolutely love how I customize with

46
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
absolutely love how I customize with
 

47
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,670
absolutely love how I customize with
some of these things with the intros and

48
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
some of these things with the intros and
 

49
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,310
some of these things with the intros and
the details. And I have the archives

50
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
the details. And I have the archives
 

51
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,389
the details. And I have the archives
page which shows me all the posts that I

52
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
page which shows me all the posts that I
 

53
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,670
page which shows me all the posts that I
published which is by the way a

54
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:57,680
published which is by the way a
 

55
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,750
published which is by the way a
completely custom page format. So I've

56
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
completely custom page format. So I've
 

57
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,430
completely custom page format. So I've
done some work on this. Like it looks

58
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
done some work on this. Like it looks
 

59
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,229
done some work on this. Like it looks
nice. I like this. But one of the things

60
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239
nice. I like this. But one of the things
 

61
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,310
nice. I like this. But one of the things
that I wanted to do is introduce a

62
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
that I wanted to do is introduce a
 

63
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,469
that I wanted to do is introduce a
concept of a reading list. And the

64
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
concept of a reading list. And the
 

65
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,230
concept of a reading list. And the
reading list is I'm an avid reader. I

66
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
reading list is I'm an avid reader. I
 

67
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,910
reading list is I'm an avid reader. I
love books. And I wanted to introduce

68
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:11,920
love books. And I wanted to introduce
 

69
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,670
love books. And I wanted to introduce
the capability to actually track the

70
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
the capability to actually track the
 

71
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,390
the capability to actually track the
books that I read and list them on this

72
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
books that I read and list them on this
 

73
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,950
books that I read and list them on this
site. So somehow I want to embed that

74
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
site. So somehow I want to embed that
 

75
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,390
site. So somehow I want to embed that
information in maybe like a separate

76
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
information in maybe like a separate
 

77
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,550
information in maybe like a separate
page. This got inspired, by the way, by

78
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
page. This got inspired, by the way, by
 

79
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,870
page. This got inspired, by the way, by
Molly White's book list. Molly is a

80
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:24,880
Molly White's book list. Molly is a
 

81
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,550
Molly White's book list. Molly is a
fantastic writer. Check out her site at

82
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
fantastic writer. Check out her site at
 

83
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,190
fantastic writer. Check out her site at
mollywhite.net. But if you look at her

84
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,200
mollywhite.net. But if you look at her
 

85
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,190
mollywhite.net. But if you look at her
book page, this is where she documents

86
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
book page, this is where she documents
 

87
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,030
book page, this is where she documents
all the books that she is reading, which

88
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
all the books that she is reading, which
 

89
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,190
all the books that she is reading, which
is kind of cool. Like you you see that

90
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
is kind of cool. Like you you see that
 

91
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,310
is kind of cool. Like you you see that
this kind of track list of items that

92
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
this kind of track list of items that
 

93
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,830
this kind of track list of items that
you might discover, new books that you

94
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
you might discover, new books that you
 

95
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,429
you might discover, new books that you
like, right? So, this is great. I wanted

96
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
like, right? So, this is great. I wanted
 

97
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,270
like, right? So, this is great. I wanted
something very similar. And for that,

98
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
something very similar. And for that,
 

99
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,990
something very similar. And for that,
I'm going to use specit. So, I have my

100
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm going to use specit. So, I have my
 

101
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,149
I'm going to use specit. So, I have my
site. We're going to go to VS Code here.

102
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
site. We're going to go to VS Code here.
 

103
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,109
site. We're going to go to VS Code here.
You'll notice that I have my GitHub repo

104
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
You'll notice that I have my GitHub repo
 

105
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,630
You'll notice that I have my GitHub repo
open. It's only typical Hugo content you

106
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
open. It's only typical Hugo content you
 

107
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,709
open. It's only typical Hugo content you
would expect from any Hugo website. Like

108
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:58,719
would expect from any Hugo website. Like
 

109
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,069
would expect from any Hugo website. Like
nothing here is specific to my blog,

110
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
nothing here is specific to my blog,
 

111
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,830
nothing here is specific to my blog,
right? Like I have my config files again

112
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
right? Like I have my config files again
 

113
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,429
right? Like I have my config files again
as any Hugo site has. It's just TOML. My

114
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
as any Hugo site has. It's just TOML. My
 

115
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,350
as any Hugo site has. It's just TOML. My
content with all the index pages, blog

116
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360
content with all the index pages, blog
 

117
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,430
content with all the index pages, blog
pages, they're just markdown files.

118
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
pages, they're just markdown files.
 

119
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,309
pages, they're just markdown files.
Again, not a lot of magic here. Themes,

120
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
Again, not a lot of magic here. Themes,
 

121
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,150
Again, not a lot of magic here. Themes,
this is where my modified Congo mod

122
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
this is where my modified Congo mod
 

123
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,470
this is where my modified Congo mod
lives. And I can modify different

124
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,480
lives. And I can modify different
 

125
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,150
lives. And I can modify different
layouts and styles. And it's a package

126
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
layouts and styles. And it's a package
 

127
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,790
layouts and styles. And it's a package
JSON because it's a node node managed

128
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
JSON because it's a node node managed
 

129
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,150
JSON because it's a node node managed
theme. So I can actually go in and

130
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
theme. So I can actually go in and
 

131
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,229
theme. So I can actually go in and
modify it and rebuild it. And that's

132
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
modify it and rebuild it. And that's
 

133
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,790
modify it and rebuild it. And that's
kind of it, right? But nonetheless, like

134
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
kind of it, right? But nonetheless, like
 

135
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,150
kind of it, right? But nonetheless, like
there's a lot of stuff that's defined

136
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
there's a lot of stuff that's defined
 

137
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,990
there's a lot of stuff that's defined
here. Like there's also like layouts

138
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
here. Like there's also like layouts
 

139
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,990
here. Like there's also like layouts
that you can track. There's all sorts of

140
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000
that you can track. There's all sorts of
 

141
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,910
that you can track. There's all sorts of
short codes that I've introduced and

142
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
short codes that I've introduced and
 

143
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,229
short codes that I've introduced and
partials and it's just one of those

144
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
partials and it's just one of those
 

145
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,509
partials and it's just one of those
things that you have to always be in the

146
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
things that you have to always be in the
 

147
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,589
things that you have to always be in the
know about the things where they are,

148
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
know about the things where they are,
 

149
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,229
know about the things where they are,
how they change, and how to change them

150
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
how they change, and how to change them
 

151
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,070
how they change, and how to change them
to introduce any new functionality. So

152
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
to introduce any new functionality. So
 

153
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,670
to introduce any new functionality. So
today we're going to experiment with

154
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
today we're going to experiment with
 

155
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,830
today we're going to experiment with
specit and we'll try to add a reading

156
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:49,840
specit and we'll try to add a reading
 

157
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,790
specit and we'll try to add a reading
list to our project. So for that I'm

158
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
list to our project. So for that I'm
 

159
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,550
list to our project. So for that I'm
going to jump back here to our CLI to

160
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
going to jump back here to our CLI to
 

161
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,790
going to jump back here to our CLI to
our terminal. We're going to use our

162
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
our terminal. We're going to use our
 

163
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,990
our terminal. We're going to use our
specify CLI and I'm going to use the d-

164
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
specify CLI and I'm going to use the d-
 

165
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,470
specify CLI and I'm going to use the d-
here command to actually bootstrap it

166
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
here command to actually bootstrap it
 

167
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,710
here command to actually bootstrap it
directly into my project folder without

168
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
directly into my project folder without
 

169
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,149
directly into my project folder without
me specifying a project name because I

170
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
me specifying a project name because I
 

171
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,710
me specifying a project name because I
can do this. So we're going to use here

172
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
can do this. So we're going to use here
 

173
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,390
can do this. So we're going to use here
and it's going to warn me that's going

174
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
and it's going to warn me that's going
 

175
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,070
and it's going to warn me that's going
to overwrite existing files and I'll say

176
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
to overwrite existing files and I'll say
 

177
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,750
to overwrite existing files and I'll say
sure, yeah, that's fine. There's not a

178
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
sure, yeah, that's fine. There's not a
 

179
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,509
sure, yeah, that's fine. There's not a
lot there that needs to be overwritten.

180
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
lot there that needs to be overwritten.
 

181
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,190
lot there that needs to be overwritten.
I'm going to use copilot with

182
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
I'm going to use copilot with
 

183
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,070
I'm going to use copilot with
PowerShell, of course. And now it's

184
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
PowerShell, of course. And now it's
 

185
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,430
PowerShell, of course. And now it's
done. I have the view of my slash

186
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
done. I have the view of my slash
 

187
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,030
done. I have the view of my slash
commands here that you might already be

188
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
commands here that you might already be
 

189
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,790
commands here that you might already be
familiar. The there's a constitution,

190
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:26,800

00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
specify, clarify, plan, task, analyze,
 

193
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,149
specify, clarify, plan, task, analyze,
and implement. We're kind of bloating

194
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
and implement. We're kind of bloating
 

195
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,830
and implement. We're kind of bloating
the command list there. But I'll show

196
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840
the command list there. But I'll show
 

197
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,070
the command list there. But I'll show
you in a new release of CISFY soon of

198
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
you in a new release of CISFY soon of
 

199
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,149
you in a new release of CISFY soon of
how this actually can be separated a bit

200
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
how this actually can be separated a bit
 

201
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,869
how this actually can be separated a bit
more cleanly. But if we look at the

202
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
more cleanly. But if we look at the
 

203
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,390
more cleanly. But if we look at the
GitHub desktop app here because that's

204
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
GitHub desktop app here because that's
 

205
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,710
GitHub desktop app here because that's
what I used for diffing and to see like

206
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
what I used for diffing and to see like
 

207
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,869
what I used for diffing and to see like
what changed.

208
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
what changed.
 

209
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,430
what changed.
Nothing here is new. We have the

210
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
Nothing here is new. We have the
 

211
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,430
Nothing here is new. We have the
prompts. We have our memory which is the

212
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
prompts. We have our memory which is the
 

213
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,110
prompts. We have our memory which is the
constitution. We have our helper scripts

214
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
constitution. We have our helper scripts
 

215
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,509
constitution. We have our helper scripts
and templates. And if I go to VS Code,

216
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
and templates. And if I go to VS Code,
 

217
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,110
and templates. And if I go to VS Code,
you'll see this as well. Right? If I

218
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
you'll see this as well. Right? If I
 

219
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,949
you'll see this as well. Right? If I
just collapse on these folders, you'll

220
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
just collapse on these folders, you'll
 

221
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,470
just collapse on these folders, you'll
see that the GitHub folder where I had

222
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
see that the GitHub folder where I had
 

223
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,550
see that the GitHub folder where I had
my workflows for GitHub actions is still

224
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
my workflows for GitHub actions is still
 

225
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,350
my workflows for GitHub actions is still
there. But now I have a prompts folder

226
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,360
there. But now I have a prompts folder
 

227
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,990
there. But now I have a prompts folder
and now I have a specify folder with the

228
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
and now I have a specify folder with the
 

229
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,990
and now I have a specify folder with the
memory scripts and templates stuff

230
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
memory scripts and templates stuff
 

231
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,350
memory scripts and templates stuff
you've seen before. So let's try and

232
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
you've seen before. So let's try and
 

233
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,789
you've seen before. So let's try and
define the constitution first. And for

234
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
define the constitution first. And for
 

235
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,630
define the constitution first. And for
this I'm going to use sonnet 4 because

236
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
this I'm going to use sonnet 4 because
 

237
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,150
this I'm going to use sonnet 4 because
it's the model that I use for a lot of

238
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
it's the model that I use for a lot of
 

239
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,550
it's the model that I use for a lot of
the coding. I will say that depending on

240
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
the coding. I will say that depending on
 

241
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,830
the coding. I will say that depending on
the context you might want to iterate

242
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
the context you might want to iterate
 

243
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,430
the context you might want to iterate
with different models. You might want to

244
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
with different models. You might want to
 

245
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,749
with different models. You might want to
try GPD5. You might try Gemini 2.5. And

246
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
try GPD5. You might try Gemini 2.5. And
 

247
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,830
try GPD5. You might try Gemini 2.5. And
you might be even try a local model.

248
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
you might be even try a local model.
 

249
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,390
you might be even try a local model.
Maybe you're using Llama. It is helpful

250
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
Maybe you're using Llama. It is helpful
 

251
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,790
Maybe you're using Llama. It is helpful
to go and experiment with different

252
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
to go and experiment with different
 

253
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,550
to go and experiment with different
variations to see what the output is

254
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
variations to see what the output is
 

255
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,830
variations to see what the output is
because the output can be varied. I'll

256
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
because the output can be varied. I'll
 

257
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,030
because the output can be varied. I'll
say depending on the model that you

258
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
say depending on the model that you
 

259
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,030
say depending on the model that you
choose. And some of the models, as you

260
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
choose. And some of the models, as you
 

261
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,950
choose. And some of the models, as you
saw in other videos, can be overeager.

262
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
saw in other videos, can be overeager.
 

263
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,790
saw in other videos, can be overeager.
Some of them can be a little bit more

264
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
Some of them can be a little bit more
 

265
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,469
Some of them can be a little bit more
restrained and they're going to be

266
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
restrained and they're going to be
 

267
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,150
restrained and they're going to be
waiting for your input to go and clarify

268
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
waiting for your input to go and clarify
 

269
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,430
waiting for your input to go and clarify
things. So this is where it's helpful to

270
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
things. So this is where it's helpful to
 

271
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,350
things. So this is where it's helpful to
get the experimentation going. For me,

272
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
get the experimentation going. For me,
 

273
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,909
get the experimentation going. For me,
Cloud Sonnet 4 is typically the model

274
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
Cloud Sonnet 4 is typically the model
 

275
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,270
Cloud Sonnet 4 is typically the model
that I choose to iterate on a lot of

276
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
that I choose to iterate on a lot of
 

277
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,310
that I choose to iterate on a lot of
these things. But now let's go to the

278
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
these things. But now let's go to the
 

279
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,070
these things. But now let's go to the
implementation. So for this, I'm going

280
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
implementation. So for this, I'm going
 

281
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,870
implementation. So for this, I'm going
to switch back to VS Code. And inside VS

282
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
to switch back to VS Code. And inside VS
 

283
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,710
to switch back to VS Code. And inside VS
Code, I'm going to start by defining the

284
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
Code, I'm going to start by defining the
 

285
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,790
Code, I'm going to start by defining the
constitution. So here, constitution.

286
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
constitution. So here, constitution.
 

287
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,830
constitution. So here, constitution.
And we already know what the

288
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
And we already know what the
 

289
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,189
And we already know what the
constitution for this should be. It's a

290
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
constitution for this should be. It's a
 

291
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,990
constitution for this should be. It's a
static site

292
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
static site
 

293
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,790
static site

This is built with Hugo.

298
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039

 

299
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:37,189

There is a theme in the themes folder.

300
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
There is a theme in the themes folder.
 

301
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,629
There is a theme in the themes folder.
Always use that for styling.

302
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639

Even if adding new styles, which is

304
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
Even if adding new styles, which is
 

305
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,150
Even if adding new styles, which is
critical because sometimes we might want

306
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
critical because sometimes we might want
 

307
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,670
critical because sometimes we might want
to add new styles that do not exist in

308
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
to add new styles that do not exist in
 

309
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,590
to add new styles that do not exist in
the theme.

00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600

 

311
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,510

All right,

312
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
All right,
 

313
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,029
All right,
let's see what else should we encode in

314
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
let's see what else should we encode in
 

315
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,390
let's see what else should we encode in
the constitution. I think we should also

316
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
the constitution. I think we should also
 

317
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,990
the constitution. I think we should also
mention that this uh always

318
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
mention that this uh always
 

319
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,670
mention that this uh always
has to be without any extra

320
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
has to be without any extra
 

321
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,510
has to be without any extra
dependencies. No extra dependencies

322
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
dependencies. No extra dependencies
 

323
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,990
dependencies. No extra dependencies
at any point.

324
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
at any point.
 

325
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,629
at any point.
No package.json or any other themes

326
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:12,639
No package.json or any other themes
 

327
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,070
No package.json or any other themes
or components, right? Because I want the

328
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
or components, right? Because I want the
 

329
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,230
or components, right? Because I want the
site to be exactly as it is right now.

330
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
site to be exactly as it is right now.
 

331
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,909
site to be exactly as it is right now.
like I'm not rearchitecting the entire

332
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
like I'm not rearchitecting the entire
 

333
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,350
like I'm not rearchitecting the entire
thing. It's an existing project. It

334
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
thing. It's an existing project. It
 

335
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,790
thing. It's an existing project. It
works. I like it. Keep it that way. So,

336
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
works. I like it. Keep it that way. So,
 

337
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,909
works. I like it. Keep it that way. So,
I'm going to go and let sonnet run and

338
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
I'm going to go and let sonnet run and
 

339
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,909
I'm going to go and let sonnet run and
see if you can get a good constitution

340
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
see if you can get a good constitution
 

341
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,629
see if you can get a good constitution
here. And the important part about the

342
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
here. And the important part about the
 

343
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,189
here. And the important part about the
constitution definition is that you have

344
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
constitution definition is that you have
 

345
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,430
constitution definition is that you have
to check it manually as well to make

346
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
to check it manually as well to make
 

347
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,350
to check it manually as well to make
sure that it actually reflects the

348
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
sure that it actually reflects the
 

349
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,270
sure that it actually reflects the
things you want to see there. Because in

350
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
things you want to see there. Because in
 

351
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,710
things you want to see there. Because in
my experiments, what I've seen happen

352
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
my experiments, what I've seen happen
 

353
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,150
my experiments, what I've seen happen
sometimes is you're going to end up at a

354
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
sometimes is you're going to end up at a
 

355
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,150
sometimes is you're going to end up at a
constitution that says all your content

356
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
constitution that says all your content
 

357
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,950
constitution that says all your content
is genuine and written by humans. Like,

358
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
is genuine and written by humans. Like,
 

359
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,350
is genuine and written by humans. Like,
yeah, I know everything on my blog is

360
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
yeah, I know everything on my blog is
 

361
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,270
yeah, I know everything on my blog is
actually written by me. I don't use AI

362
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
actually written by me. I don't use AI
 

363
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,830
actually written by me. I don't use AI
to write content. I don't use AI for

364
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
to write content. I don't use AI for
 

365
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,189
to write content. I don't use AI for
drawing or anything like that. Like to

366
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
drawing or anything like that. Like to
 

367
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,629
drawing or anything like that. Like to
me, those things are irreplaceable by

368
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
me, those things are irreplaceable by
 

369
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,749
me, those things are irreplaceable by
AI. What that means in practice is that

370
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759
AI. What that means in practice is that
 

371
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,189
AI. What that means in practice is that
I do not want those encoding

372
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
I do not want those encoding
 

373
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,390
I do not want those encoding
constitution because they have nothing

374
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
constitution because they have nothing
 

375
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,469
constitution because they have nothing
to do with the actual project. My actual

376
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
to do with the actual project. My actual
 

377
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,469
to do with the actual project. My actual
project is code. It's the website. It's

378
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
project is code. It's the website. It's
 

379
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,469
project is code. It's the website. It's
the infrastructure. I'm not asking it to

380
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
the infrastructure. I'm not asking it to
 

381
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,469
the infrastructure. I'm not asking it to
go and write content. We're not using AI

382
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:12,479
go and write content. We're not using AI
 

383
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,550
go and write content. We're not using AI
to write content. We're using AI to help

384
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
to write content. We're using AI to help
 

385
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,230
to write content. We're using AI to help
us build out the code and the

386
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
us build out the code and the
 

387
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,749
us build out the code and the
infrastructure around the site that I'm

388
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
infrastructure around the site that I'm
 

389
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,189
infrastructure around the site that I'm
building. So you have to check the

390
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
building. So you have to check the
 

391
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,469
building. So you have to check the
constitution that's being generated to

392
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
constitution that's being generated to
 

393
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,550
constitution that's being generated to
make sure that it actually reflects the

394
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
make sure that it actually reflects the
 

395
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,510
make sure that it actually reflects the
things that you care about when you're

396
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,520
things that you care about when you're
 

397
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,830
things that you care about when you're
iterating on your project. So now let's

398
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
iterating on your project. So now let's
 

399
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,150
iterating on your project. So now let's
take a look at what sonnet 4 has

400
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
take a look at what sonnet 4 has
 

401
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,070
take a look at what sonnet 4 has
produced for our constitution.

402
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080
produced for our constitution.
 

403
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,189
produced for our constitution.
All right. So there is a bunch of

404
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
All right. So there is a bunch of
 

405
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,790
All right. So there is a bunch of
changes being made. So I see my

406
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800
changes being made. So I see my
 

407
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,510
changes being made. So I see my
denomarks blog constitution. Great. It's

408
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
denomarks blog constitution. Great. It's
 

409
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,110
denomarks blog constitution. Great. It's
It's always good to be reminded what

410
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,120
It's always good to be reminded what
 

411
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,950
It's always good to be reminded what
this is about.

412
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960
this is about.
 

413
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,710
this is about.
All right.

414
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
All right.
 

415
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,790
All right.
Static side generator only. Okay, that's

416
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
Static side generator only. Okay, that's
 

417
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,790
Static side generator only. Okay, that's
reasonable. Hugo must be the sole built

418
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
reasonable. Hugo must be the sole built
 

419
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,189
reasonable. Hugo must be the sole built
tool. Yeah. Yep. Absolutely. That makes

420
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:51,199
tool. Yeah. Yep. Absolutely. That makes
 

421
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,189
tool. Yeah. Yep. Absolutely. That makes
sense. Theme based styling must ex Yep.

422
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
sense. Theme based styling must ex Yep.
 

423
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,270
sense. Theme based styling must ex Yep.
That makes perfect sense. Content first.

424
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
That makes perfect sense. Content first.
 

425
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,350
That makes perfect sense. Content first.
Mhm.

426
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
Mhm.
 

427
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,029
Mhm.
Looks right. Zero external dependencies.

428
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039

 

429
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,070

Okay. Yep, that also makes sense to me.

430
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
Okay. Yep, that also makes sense to me.
 

431
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,869
Okay. Yep, that also makes sense to me.
Performance and accessibility first.

432
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
Performance and accessibility first.
 

433
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,710
Performance and accessibility first.
All right. Yeah,

434
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720

 

435
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,390

that makes sense. Accessibility makes

436
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,400
that makes sense. Accessibility makes
 

437
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,070
that makes sense. Accessibility makes
sense. So, all these things make sense

438
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
sense. So, all these things make sense
 

439
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,749
sense. So, all these things make sense
to me. Like looking at just these

440
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:21,759
to me. Like looking at just these
 

441
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,510
to me. Like looking at just these
constraints like that seems reasonable

442
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
constraints like that seems reasonable
 

443
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,230
constraints like that seems reasonable
for the site that we're building. And we

444
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
for the site that we're building. And we
 

445
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,990
for the site that we're building. And we
also see some content standards here.

446
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
also see some content standards here.
 

447
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,830
also see some content standards here.
Semantic HTML, perfect metadata,

448
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
Semantic HTML, perfect metadata,
 

449
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,269
Semantic HTML, perfect metadata,
autonomy system, governance. Okay. All

450
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
autonomy system, governance. Okay. All
 

451
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,509
autonomy system, governance. Okay. All
right.

452
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
right.
 

453
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,149
right.
Great. So, this looks good. I think I'm

454
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
Great. So, this looks good. I think I'm
 

455
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,470
Great. So, this looks good. I think I'm
going to go ahead and just keep it as

456
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
going to go ahead and just keep it as
 

457
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,310
going to go ahead and just keep it as
is. This seems like the right strategy

458
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,320
is. This seems like the right strategy
 

459
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,509
is. This seems like the right strategy
for what we're trying to do. And the

460
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
for what we're trying to do. And the
 

461
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,790
for what we're trying to do. And the
Constitution again is going to be

462
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
Constitution again is going to be
 

463
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,790
Constitution again is going to be
applicable to the entirety of the

464
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
applicable to the entirety of the
 

465
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,870
applicable to the entirety of the
project. It's not focused on just one

466
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
project. It's not focused on just one
 

467
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,070
project. It's not focused on just one
feature or a bug fix. Constitution is

468
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
feature or a bug fix. Constitution is
 

469
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,230
feature or a bug fix. Constitution is
for everyone. So, we're going to keep

470
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
for everyone. So, we're going to keep
 

471
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,790
for everyone. So, we're going to keep
this and say this is good. And I'm going

472
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
this and say this is good. And I'm going
 

473
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,590
this and say this is good. And I'm going
to go ahead actually and yeah, actually

474
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600
to go ahead actually and yeah, actually
 

475
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,030
to go ahead actually and yeah, actually
it's already saved because I keep ke

476
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040
it's already saved because I keep ke
 

477
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,870
it's already saved because I keep ke
kept it. All right, so we're good. Now

478
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
kept it. All right, so we're good. Now
 

479
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,190
kept it. All right, so we're good. Now
it's time for us to define our very

480
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
it's time for us to define our very
 

481
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,590
it's time for us to define our very
first specification.

482
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
first specification.
 

483
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,870
first specification.
So for this, I'm going to use the /

484
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:16,880
So for this, I'm going to use the /
 

485
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,269
So for this, I'm going to use the /
specify command. And this is where, as I

486
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
specify command. And this is where, as I
 

487
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,990
specify command. And this is where, as I
mentioned before, it's important to be

488
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
mentioned before, it's important to be
 

489
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,870
mentioned before, it's important to be
very concrete about what you're trying

490
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
very concrete about what you're trying
 

491
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,590
very concrete about what you're trying
to do. And before we do this, I could

492
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
to do. And before we do this, I could
 

493
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,630
to do. And before we do this, I could
actually show you that my project builds

494
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
actually show you that my project builds
 

495
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,350
actually show you that my project builds
so that we're not hypothesizing about

496
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360
so that we're not hypothesizing about
 

497
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,990
so that we're not hypothesizing about
the fact that oh, like you're you're

498
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
the fact that oh, like you're you're
 

499
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,470
the fact that oh, like you're you're
clear, not seller. Uh it's not just

500
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
clear, not seller. Uh it's not just
 

501
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,070
clear, not seller. Uh it's not just
about me showing you something that's

502
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
about me showing you something that's
 

503
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,990
about me showing you something that's
like, oh, this magical thing is going to

504
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
like, oh, this magical thing is going to
 

505
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,829
like, oh, this magical thing is going to
run eventually. I'm I'm in my blog

506
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:43,839
run eventually. I'm I'm in my blog
 

507
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,110
run eventually. I'm I'm in my blog
folder. I'm going to go to CD Dennis

508
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
folder. I'm going to go to CD Dennis
 

509
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,030
folder. I'm going to go to CD Dennis
Dell because this is the nested folder.

510
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040
Dell because this is the nested folder.
 

511
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,389
Dell because this is the nested folder.
And here I'm going to do Hugo

512
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
And here I'm going to do Hugo
 

513
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,670
And here I'm going to do Hugo
server and then

514
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
server and then
 

515
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,509
server and then
I think the D parameter is correct.

516
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
I think the D parameter is correct.
 

517
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,470
I think the D parameter is correct.
Okay. And we'll see that this actually

518
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
Okay. And we'll see that this actually
 

519
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,190
Okay. And we'll see that this actually
renders my website. This is the local

520
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,200
renders my website. This is the local
 

521
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,870
renders my website. This is the local
copy of the website that I want to be

522
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
copy of the website that I want to be
 

523
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,310
copy of the website that I want to be
able to iterate and test. It's a

524
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
able to iterate and test. It's a
 

525
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,470
able to iterate and test. It's a
localhost 1313. So I'm just going to do

526
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,480
localhost 1313. So I'm just going to do
 

527
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,150
localhost 1313. So I'm just going to do
this and we're going to go to the

528
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160
this and we're going to go to the
 

529
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,389
this and we're going to go to the
browser. And there we go. Local host

530
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
browser. And there we go. Local host
 

531
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,310
browser. And there we go. Local host
1313. I'm running this locally. So all

532
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
1313. I'm running this locally. So all
 

533
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,110
1313. I'm running this locally. So all
of this content here is on my machine.

534
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120
of this content here is on my machine.
 

535
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,230
of this content here is on my machine.
Right. Right. So if I just scroll

536
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
Right. Right. So if I just scroll
 

537
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,910
Right. Right. So if I just scroll
through this and some of this content

538
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
through this and some of this content
 

539
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,430
through this and some of this content
loads from the CDN for the record like

540
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440
loads from the CDN for the record like
 

541
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,509
loads from the CDN for the record like
the the the the images, the photos that

542
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:23,519
the the the the images, the photos that
 

543
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,949
the the the the images, the photos that
you see here, this is CDN based, but the

544
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
you see here, this is CDN based, but the
 

545
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,870
you see here, this is CDN based, but the
content itself and the site runs

546
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
content itself and the site runs
 

547
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,350
content itself and the site runs
locally. So this is great. I now have my

548
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
locally. So this is great. I now have my
 

549
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,350
locally. So this is great. I now have my
local version. This is dendev blog which

550
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
local version. This is dendev blog which
 

551
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,710
local version. This is dendev blog which
is remote. So we're going to minimize

552
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
is remote. So we're going to minimize
 

553
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,470
is remote. So we're going to minimize
this. We don't need it. And we're going

554
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
this. We don't need it. And we're going
 

555
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,990
this. We don't need it. And we're going
to cancel out of this because we don't

556
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
to cancel out of this because we don't
 

557
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,990
to cancel out of this because we don't
need this either.

558
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
need this either.
 

559
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,670
need this either.
Let's get back to VS Code. Now we're

560
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
Let's get back to VS Code. Now we're
 

561
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,750
Let's get back to VS Code. Now we're
defining the specification for this new

562
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
defining the specification for this new
 

563
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,150
defining the specification for this new
feature that we want for a website. So,

564
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
feature that we want for a website. So,
 

565
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,389
feature that we want for a website. So,
I'm going to be very explicit about what

566
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
I'm going to be very explicit about what
 

567
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,030
I'm going to be very explicit about what
I'm doing and

568
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
I'm doing and
 

569
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,110
I'm doing and
going to get back to you looking at me

570
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
going to get back to you looking at me
 

571
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,470
going to get back to you looking at me
once I type all of this out. A few

572
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
once I type all of this out. A few
 

573
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,069
once I type all of this out. A few
moments later.

574
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079
moments later.
 

575
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,190
moments later.

the gist of it is I am defining the

I want to make sure that I'm building a

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
I want to make sure that I'm building a
 

583

I want to make sure that I'm building a
reading list page. I want to make sure

reading list page. I want to make sure
 

585
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,829
reading list page. I want to make sure
that it has a books route, right? This

586
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
that it has a books route, right? This
 

587
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,509
that it has a books route, right? This
is where on my site I can actually see

00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519
is where on my site I can actually see
 

589
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,030
is where on my site I can actually see
them. I want to make sure that the data

590
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
them. I want to make sure that the data
 

591
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,430
them. I want to make sure that the data
is populated from a config folder

592
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
is populated from a config folder
 

593
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,110
is populated from a config folder
similar to other TOML files, right? Like

594
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
similar to other TOML files, right? Like
 

595
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,870
similar to other TOML files, right? Like
I want to be modifying TOML files and

596
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
I want to be modifying TOML files and
 

597
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,030
I want to be modifying TOML files and
when I build the site with Hugo, I

598
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,040
when I build the site with Hugo, I
 

599
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,870
when I build the site with Hugo, I
actually see those books render. Notice

600
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
actually see those books render. Notice
 

601
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,030
actually see those books render. Notice
something that that that is key here,

602
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
something that that that is key here,
 

603
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,630
something that that that is key here,
right? Like I I am thinking through a

604
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,640
right? Like I I am thinking through a
 

605
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,230
right? Like I I am thinking through a
lot of these constraints and these might

606
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
lot of these constraints and these might
 

607
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,110
lot of these constraints and these might
seem like constraints that like well you

608
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
seem like constraints that like well you
 

609
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,710
seem like constraints that like well you
kind of have to know what you're doing.

610
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
kind of have to know what you're doing.
 

611
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,430
kind of have to know what you're doing.
If I know how I want to maintain the

612
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
If I know how I want to maintain the
 

613
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,150
If I know how I want to maintain the
books on my site, that's what I need to

614
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160
books on my site, that's what I need to
 

615
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,470
books on my site, that's what I need to
do. Like I don't just vibe code this

616
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,480
do. Like I don't just vibe code this
 

617
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,030
do. Like I don't just vibe code this
stuff. like I have inherent knowledge

618
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
stuff. like I have inherent knowledge
 

619
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,870
stuff. like I have inherent knowledge
about the infrastructure, about the

620
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
about the infrastructure, about the
 

621
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,110
about the infrastructure, about the
tooling, the things that I have and I

622
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,120
tooling, the things that I have and I
 

623
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,790
tooling, the things that I have and I
want them to work a certain way and I'm

624
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:50,800
want them to work a certain way and I'm
 

625
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,790
want them to work a certain way and I'm
using AI to steer it in that direction.

626
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
using AI to steer it in that direction.
 

627
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,110
using AI to steer it in that direction.
That's the superpower. So again, not

628
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
That's the superpower. So again, not
 

629
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,949
That's the superpower. So again, not
negating the need for knowledge. People

630
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
negating the need for knowledge. People
 

631
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,069
negating the need for knowledge. People
think that AI is going to just

632
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
think that AI is going to just
 

633
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,030
think that AI is going to just
completely destroy the need for

634
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040
completely destroy the need for
 

635
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,389
completely destroy the need for
engineering knowledge. It's not true.

636
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
engineering knowledge. It's not true.
 

637
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,430
engineering knowledge. It's not true.
You still need to know what you're

638
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440
You still need to know what you're
 

639
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,949
You still need to know what you're
doing. Uh you're not going to be

640
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
doing. Uh you're not going to be
 

641
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,150
doing. Uh you're not going to be
introducing security vulnerabilities

642
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,160
introducing security vulnerabilities
 

643
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,150
introducing security vulnerabilities
with vibe coding. Um that's for sure. So

644
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
with vibe coding. Um that's for sure. So
 

645
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,069
with vibe coding. Um that's for sure. So
one of the things that also I'm defining

646
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:10,079
one of the things that also I'm defining
 

647
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,750
one of the things that also I'm defining
here is again the what and the why.

648
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
here is again the what and the why.
 

649
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,509
here is again the what and the why.
Remember the specify command is all

650
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
Remember the specify command is all
 

651
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,509
Remember the specify command is all
about defining the specification. These

652
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
about defining the specification. These
 

653
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,190
about defining the specification. These
are the requirements for this. We're not

654
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,200
are the requirements for this. We're not
 

655
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,710
are the requirements for this. We're not
necessarily focusing on a technical

656
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720
necessarily focusing on a technical
 

657
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,350
necessarily focusing on a technical
stack. This is not yet the the pieces

658
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,360
stack. This is not yet the the pieces
 

659
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,910
stack. This is not yet the the pieces
that need to be um I want to say like

660
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:23,920
that need to be um I want to say like
 

661
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,430
that need to be um I want to say like
defined at this stage. We're just

662
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
defined at this stage. We're just
 

663
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,230
defined at this stage. We're just
defining the experience. So this is good

664
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,240
defining the experience. So this is good
 

665
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,350
defining the experience. So this is good
enough. Let's go and run it with Cloud

666
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
enough. Let's go and run it with Cloud
 

667
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,190
enough. Let's go and run it with Cloud
Sonnet 4 and have it run the

668
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,200
Sonnet 4 and have it run the
 

669
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,190
Sonnet 4 and have it run the
specification command. This is going to

670
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
specification command. This is going to
 

671
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,190
specification command. This is going to
bootstrap a new branch. remember because

672
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
bootstrap a new branch. remember because
 

673
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,949
bootstrap a new branch. remember because
when we create a new feature is going to

674
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
when we create a new feature is going to
 

675
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,670
when we create a new feature is going to
actually go in and uh set this up for

676
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
actually go in and uh set this up for
 

677
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,790
actually go in and uh set this up for
us. Let's run the script

678
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
us. Let's run the script
 

679
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,110
us. Let's run the script
and the branch is created. We have our

680
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
and the branch is created. We have our
 

681
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,990
and the branch is created. We have our
new specs folder with a branch name that

682
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,000
new specs folder with a branch name that
 

683
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,990
new specs folder with a branch name that
by the way it I'm looking at changing

684
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
by the way it I'm looking at changing
 

685
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,509
by the way it I'm looking at changing
this. I don't like the fact that it's a

686
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
this. I don't like the fact that it's a
 

687
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,910
this. I don't like the fact that it's a
001 I want to like that means nothing to

688
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
001 I want to like that means nothing to
 

689
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,670
001 I want to like that means nothing to
me like I want to what what does it

690
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:57,680
me like I want to what what does it
 

691
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,550
me like I want to what what does it
actually mean? Uh so that's going to

692
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
actually mean? Uh so that's going to
 

693
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,949
actually mean? Uh so that's going to
improve but in the meantime it's going

694
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
improve but in the meantime it's going
 

695
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,790
improve but in the meantime it's going
to spin up the the new branch. So now

696
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
to spin up the the new branch. So now
 

697
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,670
to spin up the the new branch. So now
we're operating in a in a new isolated I

698
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
we're operating in a in a new isolated I
 

699
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,509
we're operating in a in a new isolated I
want to say uh environment that doesn't

700
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
want to say uh environment that doesn't
 

701
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,949
want to say uh environment that doesn't
impact my main blog. I can actually

702
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
impact my main blog. I can actually
 

703
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,509
impact my main blog. I can actually
safely check this in and see how it

704
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
safely check this in and see how it
 

705
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,670
safely check this in and see how it
renders uh online or even locally

706
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,680
renders uh online or even locally
 

707
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,430
renders uh online or even locally
without modifying the core side and

708
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:17,440
without modifying the core side and
 

709
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,030
without modifying the core side and
breaking it on accident because we

710
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040
breaking it on accident because we
 

711
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,710
breaking it on accident because we
messed up some template file somewhere

712
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
messed up some template file somewhere
 

713
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,030
messed up some template file somewhere
for for the theme. So uh while it's

714
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
for for the theme. So uh while it's
 

715
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,030
for for the theme. So uh while it's
working you'll also notice here that in

716
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
working you'll also notice here that in
 

717
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,389
working you'll also notice here that in
my now I'm on the 001 I want to in my

718
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399
my now I'm on the 001 I want to in my
 

719
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,310
my now I'm on the 001 I want to in my
GitHub desktop client right? So I'm

720
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
GitHub desktop client right? So I'm
 

721
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,949
GitHub desktop client right? So I'm
clearly using a new branch and I can

722
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:32,959
clearly using a new branch and I can
 

723
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,190
clearly using a new branch and I can
safely commit these things because now I

724
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
safely commit these things because now I
 

725
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,150
safely commit these things because now I
can just say like yep this is the

726
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
can just say like yep this is the
 

727
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,990
can just say like yep this is the
constitution these are the prompts I

728
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,000
constitution these are the prompts I
 

729
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,069
constitution these are the prompts I
want to and blah blah blah whatever else

730
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079
want to and blah blah blah whatever else
 

731
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,430
want to and blah blah blah whatever else
I want to define here. So we're going to

732
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440
I want to define here. So we're going to
 

733
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,870
I want to define here. So we're going to
wait for the the spec to actually be

734
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
wait for the the spec to actually be
 

735
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,910
wait for the the spec to actually be
defined. We'll see the spec file and

736
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:45,920
defined. We'll see the spec file and
 

737
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,030
defined. We'll see the spec file and
we'll see the details pop up here in our

738
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,040
we'll see the details pop up here in our
 

739
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,870
we'll see the details pop up here in our
filled out template. So we have our

740
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
filled out template. So we have our
 

741
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,430
filled out template. So we have our
prompt and then all the details that are

742
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
prompt and then all the details that are
 

743
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,350
prompt and then all the details that are
coming in and being filled out

744
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
coming in and being filled out
 

745
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,829
coming in and being filled out
dynamically for us. The nice thing about

746
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
dynamically for us. The nice thing about
 

747
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,990
dynamically for us. The nice thing about
this is again I gave it the prompt. I

748
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
this is again I gave it the prompt. I
 

749
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,150
this is again I gave it the prompt. I
asked it to build a very specific kind

750
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
asked it to build a very specific kind
 

751
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,230
asked it to build a very specific kind
of experience and that that experience

752
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
of experience and that that experience
 

753
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,949
of experience and that that experience
is being defined for me in a PRD

754
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:06,959
is being defined for me in a PRD
 

755
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,509
is being defined for me in a PRD
standard format because we want to make

756
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:09,519
standard format because we want to make
 

757
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,949
standard format because we want to make
sure that if you're writing specs that

758
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
sure that if you're writing specs that
 

759
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,470
sure that if you're writing specs that
are consistent and somebody reading them

760
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
are consistent and somebody reading them
 

761
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,470
are consistent and somebody reading them
because specs are still good for humans.

762
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,480
because specs are still good for humans.
 

763
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,910
because specs are still good for humans.
Like this is not just for AI. This is

764
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:15,920
Like this is not just for AI. This is
 

765
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,269
Like this is not just for AI. This is
not just for computers. Specs are good

766
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:17,279
not just for computers. Specs are good
 

767
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,829
not just for computers. Specs are good
for humans too. They can go here, read

768
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:19,839
for humans too. They can go here, read
 

769
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,110
for humans too. They can go here, read
this and see how this works. So we're

770
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,120
this and see how this works. So we're
 

771
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,629
this and see how this works. So we're
going to keep this and let's take a look

772
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
going to keep this and let's take a look
 

773
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,269
going to keep this and let's take a look
here at what exactly is happening. So,

774
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:25,279
here at what exactly is happening. So,
 

775
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,670
here at what exactly is happening. So,
we have our user scenarios. So, I'm on a

776
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:27,680
we have our user scenarios. So, I'm on a
 

777
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,670
we have our user scenarios. So, I'm on a
blog homepage. When I navigate to books,

778
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
blog homepage. When I navigate to books,
 

779
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,509
blog homepage. When I navigate to books,
then I see a pageent grid of books with

780
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519
then I see a pageent grid of books with
 

781
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,829
then I see a pageent grid of books with
cover images, titles. Okay, that makes

782
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
cover images, titles. Okay, that makes
 

783
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,550
cover images, titles. Okay, that makes
sense. Mhm. Yep. A lot of these

784
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
sense. Mhm. Yep. A lot of these
 

785
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,990
sense. Mhm. Yep. A lot of these
requirements make sense.

786
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000
requirements make sense.
 

787
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,069
requirements make sense.
Yep. Makes sense. All these things make

788
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
Yep. Makes sense. All these things make
 

789
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,790
Yep. Makes sense. All these things make
sense. So, if we look at the functional

790
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
sense. So, if we look at the functional
 

791
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,310
sense. So, if we look at the functional
requirements, so must display a reading

792
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
requirements, so must display a reading
 

793
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,350
requirements, so must display a reading
list, page accessible books URI. Okay.

794
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
list, page accessible books URI. Okay.
 

795
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,990
list, page accessible books URI. Okay.
Must books data. Yep. Must display books

796
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
Must books data. Yep. Must display books
 

797
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,470
Must books data. Yep. Must display books
in a consistent grid. Makes sense. Book

798
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,480
in a consistent grid. Makes sense. Book
 

799
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,189
in a consistent grid. Makes sense. Book
cover images rounded corners. Again, all

800
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:57,199
cover images rounded corners. Again, all
 

801
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,189
cover images rounded corners. Again, all
these requirements are custom for what I

802
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
these requirements are custom for what I
 

803
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,590
these requirements are custom for what I
want the page to look like.

804
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
want the page to look like.
 

805
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,829
want the page to look like.
Book links must not create individual

806
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:03,839
Book links must not create individual
 

807
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,189
Book links must not create individual
book detail pages because I don't want

808
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199
book detail pages because I don't want
 

809
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,949
book detail pages because I don't want
them for now. Like I I thought for a

810
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:06,959
them for now. Like I I thought for a
 

811
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,150
them for now. Like I I thought for a
second I was like, well, maybe I want to

812
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
second I was like, well, maybe I want to
 

813
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,509
second I was like, well, maybe I want to
have like a book overview. Maybe I do

814
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:09,519
have like a book overview. Maybe I do
 

815
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,750
have like a book overview. Maybe I do
like a book review for a certain title.

816
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:11,760
like a book review for a certain title.
 

817
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,350
like a book review for a certain title.
But that that's overkill. Like for now,

818
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,360
But that that's overkill. Like for now,
 

819
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,750
But that that's overkill. Like for now,
I just want to have a reading list. Must

820
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:15,760
I just want to have a reading list. Must
 

821
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,030
I just want to have a reading list. Must
handle responsive design across

822
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040
handle responsive design across
 

823
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,189
handle responsive design across
different screen sizes. That all of this

824
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
different screen sizes. That all of this
 

825
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,189
different screen sizes. That all of this
makes sense. Now, the one requirement

826
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:21,199
makes sense. Now, the one requirement
 

827
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,189
makes sense. Now, the one requirement
here that I kind of missed is I want to

828
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
here that I kind of missed is I want to
 

829
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,509
here that I kind of missed is I want to
make sure that the actual book list or

830
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:27,519
make sure that the actual book list or
 

831
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,590
make sure that the actual book list or
the reading list link is displayed only

832
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:29,600
the reading list link is displayed only
 

833
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,389
the reading list link is displayed only
in the footer. And this this can be a

834
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
in the footer. And this this can be a
 

835
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,230
in the footer. And this this can be a
little of a stretch here, but we'll

836
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,240
little of a stretch here, but we'll
 

837
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,790
little of a stretch here, but we'll
include it anyway.

838
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,800
include it anyway.
 

839
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,310
include it anyway.
I want the the reading listed

840
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,320

 

841
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,069

in the footer

842
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079

 

843
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,350

along with other links.

844
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
along with other links.
 

845
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,550
along with other links.
And let's take a look at what other

846
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
And let's take a look at what other
 

847
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,470
And let's take a look at what other
links I have in a footer. So if I go

848
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:52,480
links I have in a footer. So if I go
 

849
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,629
links I have in a footer. So if I go
here to my my website, you'll notice

850
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:54,639
here to my my website, you'll notice
 

851
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,949
here to my my website, you'll notice
that I have let me just remove myself

852
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
that I have let me just remove myself
 

853
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,189
that I have let me just remove myself
from the view. My tags, workstyle, and

854
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
from the view. My tags, workstyle, and
 

855
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,350
from the view. My tags, workstyle, and
archives, right? So we want to make sure

856
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
archives, right? So we want to make sure
 

857
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,069
archives, right? So we want to make sure
that alongs alongside these tags, work

858
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079
that alongs alongside these tags, work
 

859
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,350
that alongs alongside these tags, work
style and archive links, I also display

860
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
style and archive links, I also display
 

861
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:16,150
style and archive links, I also display
the book list. So like

862
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,160

 

863
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,910

was it how I work or working with me?

864
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
was it how I work or working with me?
 

865
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,990
was it how I work or working with me?
Which one? Which one was it? Work style.

866
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,000
Which one? Which one was it? Work style.
 

867
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,710
Which one? Which one was it? Work style.
Work style. That's what it was. And work

868
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
Work style. That's what it was. And work
 

869
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,990
Work style. That's what it was. And work
style. This is controlled

870
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,000

 

871
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,790

in an existing

872
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
in an existing
 

873
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,590
in an existing
TOML config. And again, notice that I'm

874
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
TOML config. And again, notice that I'm
 

875
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,590
TOML config. And again, notice that I'm
I'm guiding it specifically to what I

876
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600
I'm guiding it specifically to what I
 

877
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,150
I'm guiding it specifically to what I
want it to be within the constraints of

878
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,160
want it to be within the constraints of
 

879
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,389
want it to be within the constraints of
my site. I don't let it guess. The more

880
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
my site. I don't let it guess. The more
 

881
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,790
my site. I don't let it guess. The more
you let the LLM guess, the more likely

882
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:42,800
you let the LLM guess, the more likely
 

883
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,310
you let the LLM guess, the more likely
it's going to go off the rails and do

884
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,320
it's going to go off the rails and do
 

885
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,590
it's going to go off the rails and do
something that you did not actually

886
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:45,600
something that you did not actually
 

887
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,670
something that you did not actually
want. So now I have a new requirement.

888
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
want. So now I have a new requirement.
 

889
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,269
want. So now I have a new requirement.
must add a reading list navigation link

00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
must add a reading list navigation link
 

891
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,790
must add a reading list navigation link
at the footer alongside existing links

00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
configuration that creates a hint for it
 

897
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,629
configuration that creates a hint for it
to say if I go and add a link I don't

898
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
to say if I go and add a link I don't
 

899
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,189
to say if I go and add a link I don't
actually need to go and rebuild the

900
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199
actually need to go and rebuild the
 

901
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,350
actually need to go and rebuild the
theme and start embedding some links and

902
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
theme and start embedding some links and
 

903

some footer HTML code like none of that
I have a I have a tunnel config for this

906
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360
I have a I have a tunnel config for this
 

907
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,630
I have a I have a tunnel config for this
just just use that okay so this is great

908
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:10,640
just just use that okay so this is great
 

909
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,150
just just use that okay so this is great
now I want to clarify I want to spot my

910
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
now I want to clarify I want to spot my
 

911
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,829
now I want to clarify I want to spot my
blind spots

912
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:17,839
blind spots
 

913
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,750
blind spots
For that, we're going to use the clarify

914
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
For that, we're going to use the clarify
 

915
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,789
For that, we're going to use the clarify
command to go and be quizzed on this

916
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:22,799
command to go and be quizzed on this
 

917
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,069
command to go and be quizzed on this
particular implementation. So, it's

918
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,079
particular implementation. So, it's
 

919
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,590
particular implementation. So, it's
going to help and identify

920
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:25,600
going to help and identify
 

921
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,230
going to help and identify
underspecified items relevant to me

922
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,240
underspecified items relevant to me
 

923
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,990
underspecified items relevant to me
based on the stuff that I'm building.

924
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
based on the stuff that I'm building.
 

925
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,950
based on the stuff that I'm building.
So, let's take a look at what the uh LLM

926
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:32,960
So, let's take a look at what the uh LLM
 

927
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,630
So, let's take a look at what the uh LLM
in this case Cloud Sonnet 4 thinks that

928
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
in this case Cloud Sonnet 4 thinks that
 

929
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,789
in this case Cloud Sonnet 4 thinks that
I might have underspecified.

930
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:36,799
I might have underspecified.
 

931
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,510
I might have underspecified.
And let's see. Pageionation behavior and

932
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520
And let's see. Pageionation behavior and
 

933
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,190
And let's see. Pageionation behavior and
data organization needs clarification.

934
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,200
data organization needs clarification.
 

935
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,270
data organization needs clarification.
All right. How should books be ordered

936
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,280
All right. How should books be ordered
 

937
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,750
All right. How should books be ordered
on the reading list? Uh-huh. Notice

938
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:45,760
on the reading list? Uh-huh. Notice
 

939
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,190
on the reading list? Uh-huh. Notice
right away that like in my initial

940
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,200
right away that like in my initial
 

941
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,950
right away that like in my initial
initial prompt I did not actually talk

942
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
initial prompt I did not actually talk
 

943
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,390
initial prompt I did not actually talk
about ordering and that's a very

944
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400
about ordering and that's a very
 

945
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,470
about ordering and that's a very
important one. They should be ordered by

946
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
important one. They should be ordered by
 

947
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,590
important one. They should be ordered by
date finished reading.

948
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:57,600
date finished reading.
 

949
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,470
date finished reading.
So most recently finished book first.

950
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
So most recently finished book first.
 

951
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,630
So most recently finished book first.
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. So we're

952
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. So we're
 

953
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,990
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. So we're
going to say a a is what I want. Notice

954
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
going to say a a is what I want. Notice
 

955
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,070
going to say a a is what I want. Notice
again like I I did not think about it in

956
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,080
again like I I did not think about it in
 

957
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,750
again like I I did not think about it in
the initial spec, but now that I'm

958
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
the initial spec, but now that I'm
 

959
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,630
the initial spec, but now that I'm
actually working through the

960
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:10,640
actually working through the
 

961
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,230
actually working through the
requirements here, I was like ah yes,

962
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,240
requirements here, I was like ah yes,
 

963
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,150
requirements here, I was like ah yes,
that that must be that must be the case.

964
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,160
that that must be that must be the case.
 

965
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,310
that that must be that must be the case.
I actually do need to embed that. Let's

966
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
I actually do need to embed that. Let's
 

967
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,830
I actually do need to embed that. Let's
see what else is going to ask us. What

968
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
see what else is going to ask us. What
 

969
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,350
see what else is going to ask us. What
did we not think about when we were

970
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,360
did we not think about when we were
 

971
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,669
did we not think about when we were
creating the reading list? The

972
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:21,679
creating the reading list? The
 

973
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,270
creating the reading list? The
pageionation size isn't specified. How

974
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,280
pageionation size isn't specified. How
 

975
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,870
pageionation size isn't specified. How
many books should be displayed per page?

976
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
many books should be displayed per page?
 

977
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,830
many books should be displayed per page?
Uh-huh. Yes, that's a good point because

978
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:27,840
Uh-huh. Yes, that's a good point because
 

979
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,830
Uh-huh. Yes, that's a good point because
for posts, we have a limit, right? If I

980
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
for posts, we have a limit, right? If I
 

981
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,990
for posts, we have a limit, right? If I
go to my website here and I have my

982
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
go to my website here and I have my
 

983
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,110
go to my website here and I have my
sites or my my blog posts, I believe I

984
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120
sites or my my blog posts, I believe I
 

985
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,029
sites or my my blog posts, I believe I
set it to either 10 or 15. I believe

986
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
set it to either 10 or 15. I believe
 

987
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,310
set it to either 10 or 15. I believe
it's 15. But for us, because we have a

988
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
it's 15. But for us, because we have a
 

989
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,350
it's 15. But for us, because we have a
bunch of books, right? like they're not

990
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
bunch of books, right? like they're not
 

991
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,190
bunch of books, right? like they're not
blog posts. We have to pageionate them

992
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,200
blog posts. We have to pageionate them
 

993
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,990
blog posts. We have to pageionate them
properly. So I want to say 20 books. So

994
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,000
properly. So I want to say 20 books. So
 

995
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,630
properly. So I want to say 20 books. So
let's do a C. I want 20 books per page

996
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640
let's do a C. I want 20 books per page
 

997
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,990
let's do a C. I want 20 books per page
and then we're going to pageionate from

998
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
and then we're going to pageionate from
 

999
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,110
and then we're going to pageionate from
there. All right.

1000
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,120
there. All right.
 

1001
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,789
there. All right.
Let's see what else. What else did we

1002
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
Let's see what else. What else did we
 

1003
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,950
Let's see what else. What else did we
not think about? That's why I love this

1004
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
not think about? That's why I love this
 

1005
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,789
not think about? That's why I love this
process is it allows me to actually

1006
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:02,799
process is it allows me to actually
 

1007
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,710
process is it allows me to actually
clarify my thought and then realize that

1008
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:04,720
clarify my thought and then realize that
 

1009
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,150
clarify my thought and then realize that
I did not have enough coffee today to

1010
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,160
I did not have enough coffee today to
 

1011
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,590
I did not have enough coffee today to
think through all of these things. The

1012
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600
think through all of these things. The
 

1013
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,789
think through all of these things. The
star rating display format needs

1014
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,799
star rating display format needs
 

1015
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,990
star rating display format needs
clarification. How should the stars

1016
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
clarification. How should the stars
 

1017
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,230
clarification. How should the stars
rating be displayed? Visual star icons

1018
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240
rating be displayed? Visual star icons
 

1019
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,390
rating be displayed? Visual star icons
just numeric rating. Visual star icons

1020
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,400
just numeric rating. Visual star icons
 

1021
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,950
just numeric rating. Visual star icons
only. No numeric text. H

1022
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960
only. No numeric text. H
 

1023
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,070
only. No numeric text. H
I I think just visual star icons is

1024
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,080
I I think just visual star icons is
 

1025
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,870
I I think just visual star icons is
fine. Visual actually. Why am I typing

1026
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
fine. Visual actually. Why am I typing
 

1027
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,630
fine. Visual actually. Why am I typing
this? I'll just say a or a and number,

1028
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
this? I'll just say a or a and number,
 

1029
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,070
this? I'll just say a or a and number,
right? Because four out of five. That's

1030
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,080
right? Because four out of five. That's
 

1031
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,310
right? Because four out of five. That's
fine.

1032
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:32,320
fine.
 

1033
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,110
fine.
Okay, let's see what else. I I'm excited

1034
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120
Okay, let's see what else. I I'm excited
 

1035
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,710
Okay, let's see what else. I I'm excited
to see this. And this is by the way

1036
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:36,720
to see this. And this is by the way
 

1037
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,710
to see this. And this is by the way
again the beauty of the process. Let let

1038
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,720
again the beauty of the process. Let let
 

1039
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,950
again the beauty of the process. Let let
the AI question you. Don't question the

1040
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:40,960
the AI question you. Don't question the
 

1041
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,430
the AI question you. Don't question the
AI all the time. How should books with

1042
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440
AI all the time. How should books with
 

1043
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,950
AI all the time. How should books with
start date but no finish date be

1044
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:44,960
start date but no finish date be
 

1045
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,710
start date but no finish date be
handled? Show the topless currently

1046
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:46,720
handled? Show the topless currently
 

1047
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,750
handled? Show the topless currently
reading with special styling.

1048
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:49,760
reading with special styling.
 

1049
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,990
reading with special styling.
I like that. I like that idea. Show the

1050
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
I like that. I like that idea. Show the
 

1051
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,549
I like that. I like that idea. Show the
top as currently reading.

1052
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559
top as currently reading.
 

1053
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,590
top as currently reading.
Don't display until finished. I I like

1054
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:57,600
Don't display until finished. I I like
 

1055
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,310
Don't display until finished. I I like
that. I I Let's Let's show the currently

1056
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,320
that. I I Let's Let's show the currently
 

1057
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,750
that. I I Let's Let's show the currently
reading. That's That's a good idea. And

1058
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:01,760
reading. That's That's a good idea. And
 

1059
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,830
reading. That's That's a good idea. And
I think Molly White actually had that

1060
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:03,840
I think Molly White actually had that
 

1061
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,070
I think Molly White actually had that
and I blanked on it when we were

1062
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
and I blanked on it when we were
 

1063
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,310
and I blanked on it when we were
designing this project. This is great.

1064
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,320
designing this project. This is great.
 

1065
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,390
designing this project. This is great.
So now the last question that needs

1066
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
So now the last question that needs
 

1067
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,510
So now the last question that needs
clarification.

1068
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:15,520

 

1069
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,150

What will this be? Toml data structure

1070
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,160
What will this be? Toml data structure
 

1071
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,830
What will this be? Toml data structure
validation needs. What should happen

1072
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:19,840
validation needs. What should happen
 

1073
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,830
validation needs. What should happen
when the tommo file has invalid or

1074
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:21,840
when the tommo file has invalid or
 

1075
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,470
when the tommo file has invalid or
missing required data?

1076
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:24,480
missing required data?
 

1077
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,710
missing required data?
Skip invalid entries. Silent display

1078
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:26,720
Skip invalid entries. Silent display
 

1079
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,310
Skip invalid entries. Silent display
valid. Show error message.

1080
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,320
valid. Show error message.
 

1081
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,350
valid. Show error message.
Error placeholders invalid entries. Hm.

1082
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,360
Error placeholders invalid entries. Hm.
 

1083
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,029
Error placeholders invalid entries. Hm.
I think it should be fairly lax. Like

1084
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039
I think it should be fairly lax. Like
 

1085
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,590
I think it should be fairly lax. Like
I'm not if I forget to add like a finish

1086
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:37,600
I'm not if I forget to add like a finish
 

1087
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,070
I'm not if I forget to add like a finish
date, I just wanted to ignore it. Like I

1088
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
date, I just wanted to ignore it. Like I
 

1089
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,310
date, I just wanted to ignore it. Like I
don't Yeah, a is fine. All right, I

1090
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,320
don't Yeah, a is fine. All right, I
 

1091
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,470
don't Yeah, a is fine. All right, I
think this is good. I think we we we

1092
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
think this is good. I think we we we
 

1093
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,870
think this is good. I think we we we
actually brought some clarity to the

1094
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:48,880
actually brought some clarity to the
 

1095
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,029
actually brought some clarity to the
specification as a product manager need

1096
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:51,039
specification as a product manager need
 

1097
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,190
specification as a product manager need
to think about a lot of these scenarios

1098
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,200
to think about a lot of these scenarios
 

1099
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,510
to think about a lot of these scenarios
and EI helped me think through these

1100
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:55,520
and EI helped me think through these
 

1101
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,669
and EI helped me think through these
which is great.

1102
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:57,679
which is great.
 

1103
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,510
which is great.
Again, we're fighting under under

1104
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
Again, we're fighting under under
 

1105
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,830
Again, we're fighting under under
specifi under specification. We're

1106
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:01,840
specifi under specification. We're
 

1107
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,830
specifi under specification. We're
fighting against underspecification

1108
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:03,840
fighting against underspecification
 

1109
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,669
fighting against underspecification
because that's the way the a lot of

1110
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:07,679
because that's the way the a lot of
 

1111
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,430
because that's the way the a lot of
these models get derailed is you

1112
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:09,440
these models get derailed is you
 

1113
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,110
these models get derailed is you
underspecify things. Okay. So we have

1114
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,120
underspecify things. Okay. So we have
 

1115
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,190
underspecify things. Okay. So we have
this now we can do plan. So plan

1116
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
this now we can do plan. So plan
 

1117
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,590
this now we can do plan. So plan
or plan we can say consult the

1118
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:19,600
or plan we can say consult the
 

1119
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,110
or plan we can say consult the
constitution. Well it's going to consult

1120
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120
constitution. Well it's going to consult
 

1121
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,350
constitution. Well it's going to consult
the constitution anyway but like consult

1122
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
the constitution anyway but like consult
 

1123
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,390
the constitution anyway but like consult
the readme for details

1124
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,400
the readme for details
 

1125
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,470
the readme for details
but we have no frameworks.

1126
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:30,480
but we have no frameworks.
 

1127
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,630
but we have no frameworks.
do not introduce new ones.

1128
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:34,640

 

1129
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,070

And we're adding a new template to the

1130
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
And we're adding a new template to the
 

1131
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,110
And we're adding a new template to the
Hugo based website. So, because for my

1132
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
Hugo based website. So, because for my
 

1133
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,470
Hugo based website. So, because for my
technical plan, like I'm not reinventing

1134
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:44,480
technical plan, like I'm not reinventing
 

1135
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,390
technical plan, like I'm not reinventing
the wheel here. Like, it's the wheel has

1136
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
the wheel here. Like, it's the wheel has
 

1137
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,390
the wheel here. Like, it's the wheel has
been invented. It's Hugo. I have

1138
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,400
been invented. It's Hugo. I have
 

1139
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,669
been invented. It's Hugo. I have
templates. I just want to make sure that

1140
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:49,679
templates. I just want to make sure that
 

1141
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,270
templates. I just want to make sure that
we're not reinventing anything new.

1142
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,280
we're not reinventing anything new.
 

1143
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,190
we're not reinventing anything new.
We're adding a new template to the Hugo

1144
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,200
We're adding a new template to the Hugo
 

1145
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,710
We're adding a new template to the Hugo
base template website. Um,

1146
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:56,720
base template website. Um,
 

1147
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,230
base template website. Um,
we will not be

1148
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
we will not be
 

1149
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,350
we will not be
using or writing any tests.

1150
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,360
using or writing any tests.
 

1151
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,950
using or writing any tests.
I don't need these these this is my

1152
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:04,960
I don't need these these this is my
 

1153
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,590
I don't need these these this is my
blog. Like I I literally do not care

1154
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
blog. Like I I literally do not care
 

1155
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,029
blog. Like I I literally do not care
about tests for my blog because I can

1156
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
about tests for my blog because I can
 

1157
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,710
about tests for my blog because I can
just debug this and diagnose this. It's

1158
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:10,720
just debug this and diagnose this. It's
 

1159
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,430
just debug this and diagnose this. It's
not an enterprise app. It's fine if

1160
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,440
not an enterprise app. It's fine if
 

1161
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,029
not an enterprise app. It's fine if
tests fail or something else because

1162
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:15,039
tests fail or something else because
 

1163
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,950
tests fail or something else because
we're going to we're going to tweak that

1164
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:16,960
we're going to we're going to tweak that
 

1165
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,070
we're going to we're going to tweak that
later if needed. So, okay, not using any

1166
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,080
later if needed. So, okay, not using any
 

1167
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,070
later if needed. So, okay, not using any
using or writing any tests. What else?

1168
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
using or writing any tests. What else?
 

1169
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,350
using or writing any tests. What else?
What else should we include in the plan

1170
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
What else should we include in the plan
 

1171
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,909
What else should we include in the plan
here? Um,

1172
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:25,919
here? Um,
 

1173
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,510
here? Um,
I think this is actually a good good

1174
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:27,520
I think this is actually a good good
 

1175
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,630
I think this is actually a good good
good start. If I could spell read me,

1176
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640
good start. If I could spell read me,
 

1177
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,390
good start. If I could spell read me,
that would be helpful. But I think this

1178
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
that would be helpful. But I think this
 

1179
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,149
that would be helpful. But I think this
is a good start. I I don't think this is

1180
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:34,159
is a good start. I I don't think this is
 

1181
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,510
is a good start. I I don't think this is
a terrible set of decisions for this.

1182
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:37,520
a terrible set of decisions for this.
 

1183
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,470
a terrible set of decisions for this.
And it's going to consult the

1184
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:38,480
And it's going to consult the
 

1185
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,230
And it's going to consult the
constitution. Okay. So, let's take a

1186
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
constitution. Okay. So, let's take a
 

1187
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,350
constitution. Okay. So, let's take a
look what is going to come up with the

1188
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,360
look what is going to come up with the
 

1189
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,590
look what is going to come up with the
plan. And as with a lot of these

1190
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:45,600
plan. And as with a lot of these
 

1191
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,590
plan. And as with a lot of these
commands, all of this is an iterative

1192
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:47,600
commands, all of this is an iterative
 

1193
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,270
commands, all of this is an iterative
process. Like it's going to go ahead and

1194
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,280
process. Like it's going to go ahead and
 

1195
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,430
process. Like it's going to go ahead and
create a bunch of artifacts that you

1196
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:51,440
create a bunch of artifacts that you
 

1197
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,350
create a bunch of artifacts that you
have seen previously. It's going to be

1198
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:53,360
have seen previously. It's going to be
 

1199
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,470
have seen previously. It's going to be
the plan. It's going to be the research.

1200
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
the plan. It's going to be the research.
 

1201
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,830
the plan. It's going to be the research.
It's going to be the the data model. But

1202
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:57,840
It's going to be the the data model. But
 

1203
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,430
It's going to be the the data model. But
you don't need to use all of them. It's

1204
00:22:59,430 --> 00:22:59,440
you don't need to use all of them. It's
 

1205
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,029
you don't need to use all of them. It's
an again because it's an iterative

1206
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039
an again because it's an iterative
 

1207
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,549
an again because it's an iterative
process. You pick and choose the things

1208
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:02,559
process. You pick and choose the things
 

1209
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,390
process. You pick and choose the things
that are relevant for your project and

1210
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
that are relevant for your project and
 

1211
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,990
that are relevant for your project and
the scale of your project. That's the

1212
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,000
the scale of your project. That's the
 

1213
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,110
the scale of your project. That's the
most important part because the scale of

1214
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,120
most important part because the scale of
 

1215
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,549
most important part because the scale of
the project can be different. You could

1216
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:08,559
the project can be different. You could
 

1217
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,350
the project can be different. You could
be writing an enterprise app or you

1218
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:11,360
be writing an enterprise app or you
 

1219
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,110
be writing an enterprise app or you
could be writing something that is going

1220
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,120
could be writing something that is going
 

1221
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,470
could be writing something that is going
to be completely isolated to just

1222
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
to be completely isolated to just
 

1223
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,149
to be completely isolated to just
yourself. It's a hobby project. It's a

1224
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
yourself. It's a hobby project. It's a
 

1225
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,549
yourself. It's a hobby project. It's a
blog. It's a iPhone app. Right? So for

1226
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:20,559
blog. It's a iPhone app. Right? So for
 

1227
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,630
blog. It's a iPhone app. Right? So for
those things, the scope is different. So

1228
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:22,640
those things, the scope is different. So
 

1229
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,310
those things, the scope is different. So
the constraints are different. So don't

1230
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
the constraints are different. So don't
 

1231
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,669
the constraints are different. So don't
feel intimidated by the templates doing

1232
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:25,679
feel intimidated by the templates doing
 

1233
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:26,789
feel intimidated by the templates doing
a lot of things. You can always tweak

1234
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:26,799
a lot of things. You can always tweak
 

1235
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,070
a lot of things. You can always tweak
it. You can always cut things that are

1236
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,080
it. You can always cut things that are
 

1237
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,909
it. You can always cut things that are
unnecessary. And like in my case, I know

1238
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
unnecessary. And like in my case, I know
 

1239
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,070
unnecessary. And like in my case, I know
that the plan for a fact in previous

1240
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,080
that the plan for a fact in previous
 

1241
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,070
that the plan for a fact in previous
applications was always creating a bunch

1242
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
applications was always creating a bunch
 

1243
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,470
applications was always creating a bunch
of stuff for tests. And I don't want

1244
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
of stuff for tests. And I don't want
 

1245
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,950
of stuff for tests. And I don't want
tests here. I want this to move fast and

1246
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:38,960
tests here. I want this to move fast and
 

1247
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,789
tests here. I want this to move fast and
I want it to just run and I want to see

1248
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:40,799
I want it to just run and I want to see
 

1249
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,149
I want it to just run and I want to see
my beautiful book list on my website.

1250
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:44,159
my beautiful book list on my website.
 

1251
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,230
my beautiful book list on my website.
And that's that's it. So, we're going to

1252
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,240
And that's that's it. So, we're going to
 

1253
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,070
And that's that's it. So, we're going to
wait for our agent to go in and finish

1254
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,080
wait for our agent to go in and finish
 

1255
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,950
wait for our agent to go in and finish
the work here and get us to exactly

1256
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:52,960
the work here and get us to exactly
 

1257
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,470
the work here and get us to exactly
where we need to be.

1258
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:54,480
where we need to be.
 

1259
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,190
where we need to be.
>> Don't let your dreams be dreams.

1260
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
>> Don't let your dreams be dreams.
 

1261
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,190
>> Don't let your dreams be dreams.
>> Okay, so we now have a plan and that is

1262
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200
>> Okay, so we now have a plan and that is
 

1263
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,029
>> Okay, so we now have a plan and that is
great. So, I have my plan file. I have a

1264
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:03,039
great. So, I have my plan file. I have a
 

1265
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,190
great. So, I have my plan file. I have a
bunch of other metadata documents here

1266
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,200
bunch of other metadata documents here
 

1267
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,270
bunch of other metadata documents here
that are embedded that are maybe not as

1268
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:07,280
that are embedded that are maybe not as
 

1269
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,470
that are embedded that are maybe not as
relevant here, but we'll check them out

1270
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
relevant here, but we'll check them out
 

1271
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,510
relevant here, but we'll check them out
anyway. So, we're going to keep the

1272
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,520
anyway. So, we're going to keep the
 

1273
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,029
anyway. So, we're going to keep the
changes. We're going to take a look

1274
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:11,039
changes. We're going to take a look
 

1275
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,029
changes. We're going to take a look
here. We have the plan file that

1276
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:13,039
here. We have the plan file that
 

1277
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,470
here. We have the plan file that
contains the details of our

1278
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,480
contains the details of our
 

1279
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,230
contains the details of our
implementation. Right. So we have our

1280
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:16,240
implementation. Right. So we have our
 

1281
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,870
implementation. Right. So we have our
constitutional checks static site

1282
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:18,880
constitutional checks static site
 

1283
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,630
constitutional checks static site
themebased styling. Yep. Makes sense.

1284
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640
themebased styling. Yep. Makes sense.
 

1285
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,149
themebased styling. Yep. Makes sense.
Content first. Yep. Zero external

1286
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:22,159
Content first. Yep. Zero external
 

1287
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,630
Content first. Yep. Zero external
dependencies. All right. And then we

1288
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:24,640
dependencies. All right. And then we
 

1289
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,549
dependencies. All right. And then we
have the summary, right? The

1290
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:26,559
have the summary, right? The
 

1291
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,630
have the summary, right? The
pageionation. It outlines some of the

1292
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:28,640
pageionation. It outlines some of the
 

1293
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,149
pageionation. It outlines some of the
the actual context of the research done.

1294
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:32,159
the actual context of the research done.
 

1295
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,590
the actual context of the research done.
So it has the config the default where

1296
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
So it has the config the default where
 

1297
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,390
So it has the config the default where
the Hugo configuration is. It outlines

1298
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:36,400
the Hugo configuration is. It outlines
 

1299
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,190
the Hugo configuration is. It outlines
the format of my blog. It actually sees

1300
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200
the format of my blog. It actually sees
 

1301
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,630
the format of my blog. It actually sees
the content. So it has like oh you have

1302
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:40,640
the content. So it has like oh you have
 

1303
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,909
the content. So it has like oh you have
the theme you have the templates the

1304
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919
the theme you have the templates the
 

1305
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,669
the theme you have the templates the
layouts static and uh this is where the

1306
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:43,679
layouts static and uh this is where the
 

1307
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,590
layouts static and uh this is where the
stuff is generated. So great it actually

1308
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,600
stuff is generated. So great it actually
 

1309
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,950
stuff is generated. So great it actually
knows the structure. The fact that it

1310
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:46,960
knows the structure. The fact that it
 

1311
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,110
knows the structure. The fact that it
has a structure at hand means that it's

1312
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
has a structure at hand means that it's
 

1313
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,390
has a structure at hand means that it's
probably going to generate the right

1314
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,400
probably going to generate the right
 

1315
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,470
probably going to generate the right
thing. I I am I am hopeful here that

1316
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:52,480
thing. I I am I am hopeful here that
 

1317
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,029
thing. I I am I am hopeful here that
this is going to go the right way. So uh

1318
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:55,039
this is going to go the right way. So uh
 

1319
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,029
this is going to go the right way. So uh
let's see generate contract test from

1320
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,039
let's see generate contract test from
 

1321
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,390
let's see generate contract test from
contracts one test per file per

1322
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400
contracts one test per file per
 

1323
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,789
contracts one test per file per
endpoint. Like a lot of these things uh

1324
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
endpoint. Like a lot of these things uh
 

1325
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,430
endpoint. Like a lot of these things uh
yeah I don't want to do that. So here

1326
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,440
yeah I don't want to do that. So here
 

1327
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,590
yeah I don't want to do that. So here
because as I mentioned like this this is

1328
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:07,600
because as I mentioned like this this is
 

1329
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,350
because as I mentioned like this this is
a tweakable project. We're going to say

1330
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,360
a tweakable project. We're going to say
 

1331
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,510
a tweakable project. We're going to say
remove anything to do with tests

1332
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
remove anything to do with tests
 

1333
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,310
remove anything to do with tests
from the plan. We do not want tests

1334
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320
from the plan. We do not want tests
 

1335
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,789
from the plan. We do not want tests
for this project

1336
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:20,799
for this project
 

1337
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,390
for this project
because I don't want it to just overkill

1338
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:22,400
because I don't want it to just overkill
 

1339
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,669
because I don't want it to just overkill
this with a bunch of stuff that I did

1340
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:23,679
this with a bunch of stuff that I did
 

1341
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,510
this with a bunch of stuff that I did
not ask it to do. So, we're going to ask

1342
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:25,520
not ask it to do. So, we're going to ask
 

1343
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,110
not ask it to do. So, we're going to ask
it to remove test related stuff from the

1344
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,120
it to remove test related stuff from the
 

1345
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,669
it to remove test related stuff from the
plan. See, human in the loop. You still

1346
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:29,679
plan. See, human in the loop. You still
 

1347
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,870
plan. See, human in the loop. You still
have to do this stuff. So, let's see.

1348
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:32,880
have to do this stuff. So, let's see.
 

1349
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,070
have to do this stuff. So, let's see.
Generate template contracts from

1350
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,080
Generate template contracts from
 

1351
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,269
Generate template contracts from
functional requirements. Hugo template

1352
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:35,279
functional requirements. Hugo template
 

1353
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,590
functional requirements. Hugo template
specification. Yep, makes sense. output

1354
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:37,600
specification. Yep, makes sense. output
 

1355
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,750
specification. Yep, makes sense. output
template contracts to contracts. Um,

1356
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:41,760
template contracts to contracts. Um,
 

1357
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,950
template contracts to contracts. Um,
sure. Okay. Yeah, maybe. Maybe.

1358
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:46,960
sure. Okay. Yeah, maybe. Maybe.
 

1359
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,070
sure. Okay. Yeah, maybe. Maybe.
And then I remove some test stuff.

1360
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,080
And then I remove some test stuff.
 

1361
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,430
And then I remove some test stuff.
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1362
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:53,440
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
 

1363
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,190
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Make test pass. Yeah. We're just like

1364
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,200
Make test pass. Yeah. We're just like
 

1365
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,190
Make test pass. Yeah. We're just like
test is just too much. We don't want

1366
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,200
test is just too much. We don't want
 

1367
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,029
test is just too much. We don't want
test right now. We're we're kind of

1368
00:25:59,029 --> 00:25:59,039
test right now. We're we're kind of
 

1369
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,269
test right now. We're we're kind of
specking this in a way that fits my blog

1370
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:01,279
specking this in a way that fits my blog
 

1371
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,269
specking this in a way that fits my blog
scenario. My blog has never used tests

1372
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:03,279
scenario. My blog has never used tests
 

1373
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,029
scenario. My blog has never used tests
for better or for worse. So, let's take

1374
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:05,039
for better or for worse. So, let's take
 

1375
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,430
for better or for worse. So, let's take
a look. So, um I'm going to actually

1376
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:07,440
a look. So, um I'm going to actually
 

1377
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,070
a look. So, um I'm going to actually
take do do a very naive thing and I'm

1378
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,080
take do do a very naive thing and I'm
 

1379
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,029
take do do a very naive thing and I'm
just going to search for test and let's

1380
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:13,039
just going to search for test and let's
 

1381
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,510
just going to search for test and let's
see phase five validation execute quick

1382
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:15,520
see phase five validation execute quick
 

1383
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,789
see phase five validation execute quick
start manual testing performance. All

1384
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:16,799
start manual testing performance. All
 

1385
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,470
start manual testing performance. All
right, that that's fair. That stuff can

1386
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:18,480
right, that that's fair. That stuff can
 

1387
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,830
right, that that's fair. That stuff can
can live there. No test and test per

1388
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:19,840
can live there. No test and test per
 

1389
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,190
can live there. No test and test per
user specification. Okay, manual testing

1390
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,200
user specification. Okay, manual testing
 

1391
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,630
user specification. Okay, manual testing
and validation. All right, so I think

1392
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:24,640
and validation. All right, so I think
 

1393
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,830
and validation. All right, so I think
we're good. It did not actually

1394
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:25,840
we're good. It did not actually
 

1395
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,350
we're good. It did not actually
overprovision this with a bunch of test

1396
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:27,360
overprovision this with a bunch of test
 

1397
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,549
overprovision this with a bunch of test
related stuff. Let's see what what did

1398
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:28,559
related stuff. Let's see what what did
 

1399
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,190
related stuff. Let's see what what did
it put in contracts uh configuration.

1400
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:33,200
it put in contracts uh configuration.
 

1401
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,390
it put in contracts uh configuration.
Ah, look at that. It actually

1402
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:34,400
Ah, look at that. It actually
 

1403
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,549
Ah, look at that. It actually
understood, remember the links, the toml

1404
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:36,559
understood, remember the links, the toml
 

1405
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,070
understood, remember the links, the toml
files. It actually pulled this in. It's

1406
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,080
files. It actually pulled this in. It's
 

1407
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,029
files. It actually pulled this in. It's
like, okay, this is how we're going to

1408
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:39,039
like, okay, this is how we're going to
 

1409
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,750
like, okay, this is how we're going to
introduce this. Okay. Yeah. Nice, nice,

1410
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:41,760
introduce this. Okay. Yeah. Nice, nice,
 

1411
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,950
introduce this. Okay. Yeah. Nice, nice,
nice, nice, nice. Books index. Okay.

1412
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:44,960
nice, nice, nice. Books index. Okay.
 

1413
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,870
nice, nice, nice. Books index. Okay.
Yep. Yep. That's fair. So, it actually

1414
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
Yep. Yep. That's fair. So, it actually
 

1415
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,149
Yep. Yep. That's fair. So, it actually
is going to introduce a new content

1416
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:48,159
is going to introduce a new content
 

1417
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,909
is going to introduce a new content
page. The same way I have my archives,

1418
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:49,919
page. The same way I have my archives,
 

1419
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,269
page. The same way I have my archives,
by the way, like right like you see this

1420
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:51,279
by the way, like right like you see this
 

1421
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,669
by the way, like right like you see this
archives. If you look here, it has a

1422
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:53,679
archives. If you look here, it has a
 

1423
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,430
archives. If you look here, it has a
custom layout that is used for archives.

1424
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,440
custom layout that is used for archives.
 

1425
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,350
custom layout that is used for archives.
So, it did the same for books. It

1426
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
So, it did the same for books. It
 

1427
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,470
So, it did the same for books. It
basically said like, oh, you're going to

1428
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:58,480
basically said like, oh, you're going to
 

1429
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,430
basically said like, oh, you're going to
have a books. I'm going to have an

1430
00:26:59,430 --> 00:26:59,440
have a books. I'm going to have an
 

1431
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,830
have a books. I'm going to have an
index.md in the content folder, and this

1432
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:01,840
index.md in the content folder, and this
 

1433
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,510
index.md in the content folder, and this
is where all the content is going to go.

1434
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
is where all the content is going to go.
 

1435
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,149
is where all the content is going to go.
So just a template

1436
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:06,159
So just a template
 

1437
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,870
So just a template
um

1438
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:08,880
um
 

1439
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,390
um
reading directory structure uh for the

1440
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:12,400
reading directory structure uh for the
 

1441
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,909
reading directory structure uh for the
required directory structure.

1442
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:15,919
required directory structure.
 

1443
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,430
required directory structure.
This is where we can clarify because I'm

1444
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
This is where we can clarify because I'm
 

1445
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,990
This is where we can clarify because I'm
reading the plan.

1446
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,000

 

1447
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,549

I like the approach of the markdown file

1448
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:24,559
I like the approach of the markdown file
 

1449
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,710
I like the approach of the markdown file
that we can then apply a template layout

1450
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:28,720
that we can then apply a template layout
 

1451
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,470
that we can then apply a template layout
to.

1452
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
to.
 

1453
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,190
to.
Right? because like that's that's what

1454
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,200
Right? because like that's that's what
 

1455
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,950
Right? because like that's that's what
the beauty of this is. I like having a

1456
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:34,960
the beauty of this is. I like having a
 

1457
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,470
the beauty of this is. I like having a
markdown file. I keep repeating that

1458
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:36,480
markdown file. I keep repeating that
 

1459
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,990
markdown file. I keep repeating that
this there's a beauty in this, but there

1460
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,000
this there's a beauty in this, but there
 

1461
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,190
this there's a beauty in this, but there
there really is a kind of a a nice

1462
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,200
there really is a kind of a a nice
 

1463
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,909
there really is a kind of a a nice
approach to this process because it

1464
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:43,919
approach to this process because it
 

1465
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,830
approach to this process because it
understands. So understand this might be

1466
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:45,840
understands. So understand this might be
 

1467
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,950
understands. So understand this might be
a stretch for what we're actually doing

1468
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:46,960
a stretch for what we're actually doing
 

1469
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,789
a stretch for what we're actually doing
here, but it actually has the context of

1470
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:50,799
here, but it actually has the context of
 

1471
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,230
here, but it actually has the context of
the codebase that I'm working on and

1472
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,240
the codebase that I'm working on and
 

1473
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,470
the codebase that I'm working on and
then it applies that context to the

1474
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:54,480
then it applies that context to the
 

1475
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,230
then it applies that context to the
things that I'm working on throughout

1476
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:56,240
things that I'm working on throughout
 

1477
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,149
things that I'm working on throughout
this new feature. So I'm going to keep

1478
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:58,159
this new feature. So I'm going to keep
 

1479
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,190
this new feature. So I'm going to keep
this change and okay to clarify some

1480
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,200
this change and okay to clarify some
 

1481
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,870
this change and okay to clarify some
things. Okay. So now that we have the

1482
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:04,880
things. Okay. So now that we have the
 

1483
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,389
things. Okay. So now that we have the
plan, let's break this down into tasks,

1484
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:08,399
plan, let's break this down into tasks,
 

1485
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,070
plan, let's break this down into tasks,
right? Because we we've we've looked at

1486
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,080
right? Because we we've we've looked at
 

1487
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,830
right? Because we we've we've looked at
the plan. There's a bunch of stuff

1488
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:11,840
the plan. There's a bunch of stuff
 

1489
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,149
the plan. There's a bunch of stuff
related to it. Let's take a look at what

1490
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,159
related to it. Let's take a look at what
 

1491
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,830
related to it. Let's take a look at what
it sees as tasks. So we're going to do

1492
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:15,840
it sees as tasks. So we're going to do
 

1493
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,669
it sees as tasks. So we're going to do
tasks and we don't need anything else.

1494
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:17,679
tasks and we don't need anything else.
 

1495
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,350
tasks and we don't need anything else.
So, we're just going to run tasks

1496
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:19,360
So, we're just going to run tasks
 

1497
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,510
So, we're just going to run tasks
because I want to see based on the

1498
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:21,520
because I want to see based on the
 

1499
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,750
because I want to see based on the
details that we've provided what set of

1500
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:25,760
details that we've provided what set of
 

1501
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,389
details that we've provided what set of
things it needs to go and build for us

1502
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:28,399
things it needs to go and build for us
 

1503
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,630
things it needs to go and build for us
to be able to see the changes and see

1504
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:30,640
to be able to see the changes and see
 

1505
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,909
to be able to see the changes and see
this book list that I want on my site.

1506
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:33,919
this book list that I want on my site.
 

1507
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,830
this book list that I want on my site.
I'm in control of the process. I'm in

1508
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:35,840
I'm in control of the process. I'm in
 

1509
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,870
I'm in control of the process. I'm in
control of the end to end experience

1510
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:38,880
control of the end to end experience
 

1511
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,190
control of the end to end experience
here. And like I've had these questions

1512
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,200
here. And like I've had these questions
 

1513
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,389
here. And like I've had these questions
asked on YouTube, on uh GitHub as It's

1514
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:44,399
asked on YouTube, on uh GitHub as It's
 

1515
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,630
asked on YouTube, on uh GitHub as It's
like, well, if you do this one shot of a

1516
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:46,640
like, well, if you do this one shot of a
 

1517
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,549
like, well, if you do this one shot of a
spec, one shot of a plan, and the plan

1518
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:48,559
spec, one shot of a plan, and the plan
 

1519
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,430
spec, one shot of a plan, and the plan
is not right, does it mean I just have

1520
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:51,440
is not right, does it mean I just have
 

1521
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,350
is not right, does it mean I just have
to redo the entire process from scratch?

1522
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:53,360
to redo the entire process from scratch?
 

1523
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,950
to redo the entire process from scratch?
No, absolutely not. That's why they're

1524
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:54,960
No, absolutely not. That's why they're
 

1525
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,870
No, absolutely not. That's why they're
markdown files. You go in, you change or

1526
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:56,880
markdown files. You go in, you change or
 

1527
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,110
markdown files. You go in, you change or
you ask the LLM to change it, and then

1528
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,120
you ask the LLM to change it, and then
 

1529
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,710
you ask the LLM to change it, and then
make sure that is reflected in the plan.

1530
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:00,720
make sure that is reflected in the plan.
 

1531
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,990
make sure that is reflected in the plan.
You're operating on a branch. You're

1532
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,000
You're operating on a branch. You're
 

1533
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,470
You're operating on a branch. You're
operating in an isolated specs folder

1534
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:04,480
operating in an isolated specs folder
 

1535
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,029
operating in an isolated specs folder
that is dedicated for that project.

1536
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:07,039
that is dedicated for that project.
 

1537
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,870
that is dedicated for that project.
That's it. Like, just make the change.

1538
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:08,880
That's it. Like, just make the change.
 

1539
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,310
That's it. Like, just make the change.
You don't need to reset anything. You

1540
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:10,320
You don't need to reset anything. You
 

1541
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,070
You don't need to reset anything. You
need to rebuild a bunch of stuff. So,

1542
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,080
need to rebuild a bunch of stuff. So,
 

1543
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,310
need to rebuild a bunch of stuff. So,
it's it's kind of neat. I like I like

1544
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:14,320
it's it's kind of neat. I like I like
 

1545
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,669
it's it's kind of neat. I like I like
this lightweight approach to it. It's

1546
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:15,679
this lightweight approach to it. It's
 

1547
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,909
this lightweight approach to it. It's
like I'm not necessarily bound to the

1548
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:17,919
like I'm not necessarily bound to the
 

1549
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,669
like I'm not necessarily bound to the
the first generated spec to be the

1550
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:19,679
the first generated spec to be the
 

1551
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,470
the first generated spec to be the
source of truth forever. So it generated

1552
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:22,480
source of truth forever. So it generated
 

1553
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,990
source of truth forever. So it generated
a task. Let's take a look. I'm going to

1554
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,000
a task. Let's take a look. I'm going to
 

1555
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,430
a task. Let's take a look. I'm going to
scroll here so you can see that I'm

1556
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,440
scroll here so you can see that I'm
 

1557
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,110
scroll here so you can see that I'm
going actually going to the tasks file,

1558
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,120
going actually going to the tasks file,
 

1559
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,350
going actually going to the tasks file,
right? It's like I'm going to hide

1560
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:29,360
right? It's like I'm going to hide
 

1561
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,149
right? It's like I'm going to hide
myself again. So we see the task file.

1562
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:32,159
myself again. So we see the task file.
 

1563
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,430
myself again. So we see the task file.
Let's keep it. Let's take a look at the

1564
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:33,440
Let's keep it. Let's take a look at the
 

1565
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,909
Let's keep it. Let's take a look at the
tasks. So it has some items here. Let's

1566
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:35,919
tasks. So it has some items here. Let's
 

1567
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,590
tasks. So it has some items here. Let's
look at the sections. So I'm curious

1568
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:37,600
look at the sections. So I'm curious
 

1569
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,630
look at the sections. So I'm curious
because this is what the breakdown is.

1570
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:38,640
because this is what the breakdown is.
 

1571
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,190
because this is what the breakdown is.
So create data directory.

1572
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,200
So create data directory.
 

1573
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,909
So create data directory.
Create books data file. Then I sell data

1574
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:43,919
Create books data file. Then I sell data
 

1575
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,029
Create books data file. Then I sell data
books toml with sample book entries per

1576
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:47,039
books toml with sample book entries per
 

1577
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,590
books toml with sample book entries per
data model MD structure. I think this is

1578
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:49,600
data model MD structure. I think this is
 

1579
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,630
data model MD structure. I think this is
where

1580
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:52,640

 

1581
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,590

yeah I think similar to this if it's

1582
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:55,600
yeah I think similar to this if it's
 

1583
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,190
yeah I think similar to this if it's
going to I'm just cross-checking the

1584
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:57,200
going to I'm just cross-checking the
 

1585
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,830
going to I'm just cross-checking the
folder. So we have my config default and

1586
00:29:59,830 --> 00:29:59,840
folder. So we have my config default and
 

1587
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,549
folder. So we have my config default and
maybe I'm going to have data here which

1588
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:02,559
maybe I'm going to have data here which
 

1589
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,070
maybe I'm going to have data here which
I think is reasonable. I think that's a

1590
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,080
I think is reasonable. I think that's a
 

1591
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,549
I think is reasonable. I think that's a
hug like it's an ideatic Hugo construct.

1592
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:06,559
hug like it's an ideatic Hugo construct.
 

1593
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,830
hug like it's an ideatic Hugo construct.
I think that's fine. I think that should

1594
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:07,840
I think that's fine. I think that should
 

1595
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,350
I think that's fine. I think that should
be okay. and create book data file books

1596
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,360
be okay. and create book data file books

00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:27,679
Uh yep. This makes sense. I think this

00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:44,640
Yeah.
 

1625
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,029
Yeah.
Okay. This this looks reasonable. This

Okay. This this looks reasonable. This
 

1627
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,230
Okay. This this looks reasonable. This
looks reasonable to me. Uh I want to now

1628
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,240
looks reasonable to me. Uh I want to now
 

1629
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,549
looks reasonable to me. Uh I want to now
run analyze

1630
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:52,559
run analyze
 

1631
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,070
run analyze
just to see if there's any kind of

1632
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,080
just to see if there's any kind of
 

1633
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,990
just to see if there's any kind of
constitutional violations here and the

1634
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,000
constitutional violations here and the
 

1635
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,990
constitutional violations here and the
the the cross of the documents that we

1636
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,000
the the cross of the documents that we
 

1637
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,269
the the cross of the documents that we
have here. So we have task, we have a

1638
00:30:59,269 --> 00:30:59,279
have here. So we have task, we have a
 

1639
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,029
have here. So we have task, we have a
plan, we have the spec. I want to know

1640
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:01,039
plan, we have the spec. I want to know
 

1641
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,470
plan, we have the spec. I want to know
if there's anything here that stands out

1642
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:02,480
if there's anything here that stands out
 

1643
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,350
if there's anything here that stands out
that's like critical. So we're going to

1644
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:05,360
that's like critical. So we're going to
 

1645
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,990
that's like critical. So we're going to
rerun this. There's a helper script that

1646
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,000
rerun this. There's a helper script that
 

1647
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,909
rerun this. There's a helper script that
just gives me the path for the metadata

1648
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:09,919
just gives me the path for the metadata
 

1649
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,190
just gives me the path for the metadata
documents that exist. And we're going to

1650
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,200
documents that exist. And we're going to
 

1651
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,389
documents that exist. And we're going to
see what is out there that might be

1652
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:14,399
see what is out there that might be
 

1653
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,510
see what is out there that might be
conflicting with the specification that

1654
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:17,520
conflicting with the specification that
 

1655
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,789
conflicting with the specification that
we established in the constitution that

1656
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:18,799
we established in the constitution that
 

1657
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:19,909
we established in the constitution that
we established for this project. Again,

1658
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:19,919
we established for this project. Again,
 

1659
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,990
we established for this project. Again,
it sounds looking at the task list. It

1660
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,000
it sounds looking at the task list. It
 

1661
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,350
it sounds looking at the task list. It
sounds reasonable. This sounds like it's

1662
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:23,360
sounds reasonable. This sounds like it's
 

1663
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,669
sounds reasonable. This sounds like it's
a decent enough set of things to cover

1664
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:27,679
a decent enough set of things to cover
 

1665
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,230
a decent enough set of things to cover
and I'm going to leave it at that. But

1666
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,240
and I'm going to leave it at that. But
 

1667
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,830
and I'm going to leave it at that. But
maybe I'm missing something because

1668
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:31,840
maybe I'm missing something because
 

1669
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,430
maybe I'm missing something because
again, humans are not perfect. Sometimes

1670
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:33,440
again, humans are not perfect. Sometimes
 

1671
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,470
again, humans are not perfect. Sometimes
you're just going to read through this

1672
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:34,480
you're just going to read through this
 

1673
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,149
you're just going to read through this
and you were tired and like me did not

1674
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:36,159
and you were tired and like me did not
 

1675
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,190
and you were tired and like me did not
have enough coffee and all of a sudden

1676
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,200
have enough coffee and all of a sudden
 

1677
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,230
have enough coffee and all of a sudden
you're looking at potential issues. So

1678
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:40,240
you're looking at potential issues. So
 

1679
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,430
you're looking at potential issues. So
let's take a look at what the

1680
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:41,440
let's take a look at what the
 

1681
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,950
let's take a look at what the
specification analysis like. There's a

1682
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:42,960
specification analysis like. There's a
 

1683
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,269
specification analysis like. There's a
severity. So medium, right? And the spec

1684
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:45,279
severity. So medium, right? And the spec
 

1685
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,789
severity. So medium, right? And the spec
says config data directory but plan

1686
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:46,799
says config data directory but plan
 

1687
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,590
says config data directory but plan
consistently uses data standardize and

1688
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:49,600
consistently uses data standardize and
 

1689
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,590
consistently uses data standardize and
data location standard. Uhhuh. Okay.

1690
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:51,600
data location standard. Uhhuh. Okay.
 

1691
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,110
data location standard. Uhhuh. Okay.
Yeah, that makes sense. Standardize on

1692
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,120
Yeah, that makes sense. Standardize on
 

1693
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,190
Yeah, that makes sense. Standardize on
data location. Hugo standard. Great.

1694
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,200
data location. Hugo standard. Great.
 

1695
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,389
data location. Hugo standard. Great.
Yeah, this is what I mentioned before

1696
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:56,399
Yeah, this is what I mentioned before
 

1697
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,750
Yeah, this is what I mentioned before
because I was looking at the folder here

1698
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:57,760
because I was looking at the folder here
 

1699
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,549
because I was looking at the folder here
and I noticed that it was saying oh

1700
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:00,559
and I noticed that it was saying oh
 

1701
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,230
and I noticed that it was saying oh
Dennisell content, right? And Dennisell

1702
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,240
Dennisell content, right? And Dennisell
 

1703
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,909
Dennisell content, right? And Dennisell
uh the what is the configuration, right?

1704
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:05,919
uh the what is the configuration, right?
 

1705
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,870
uh the what is the configuration, right?
Like the the config file was uh for

1706
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:08,880
Like the the config file was uh for
 

1707
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,950
Like the the config file was uh for
data. Oh, there we go. There's Dennisell

1708
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:10,960
data. Oh, there we go. There's Dennisell
 

1709
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,830
data. Oh, there we go. There's Dennisell
data and there's a config and I

1710
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:13,840
data and there's a config and I
 

1711
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,190
data and there's a config and I
initially made that assumption like oh

1712
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,200
initially made that assumption like oh
 

1713
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,230
initially made that assumption like oh
it's going to go in the config file

1714
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,240
it's going to go in the config file
 

1715
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,750
it's going to go in the config file
because that's that's where all the TOML

1716
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:17,760
because that's that's where all the TOML
 

1717
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,669
because that's that's where all the TOML
files are. But it correctly identified

1718
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:19,679
files are. But it correctly identified
 

1719
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,070
files are. But it correctly identified
the fact that it's a Hugo standard. Max

1720
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,080
the fact that it's a Hugo standard. Max
 

1721
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,149
the fact that it's a Hugo standard. Max

You know some of these things are I

You know some of these things are I

You know some of these things are I
think are valid.

1738

Like I I think this this might be

1740
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:44,159
Like I I think this this might be
 

1741
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,149
Like I I think this this might be
reasonable.

1742
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:46,159
reasonable.
 

1743
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,990

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,590
no constitutional viol violations.
There's improvements, right? So, I want

1746
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:49,600
There's improvements, right? So, I want
 

1747
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,590
There's improvements, right? So, I want
to do like the I1 and A1.

1748
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:55,600
to do like the I1 and A1.
 

1749
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,190
to do like the I1 and A1.
Like these to me stand out as things

1750
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,200
Like these to me stand out as things
 

1751
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,389
Like these to me stand out as things
that probably I should cover and the

1752
00:32:58,389 --> 00:32:58,399
that probably I should cover and the
 

1753
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,470
that probably I should cover and the
rest of them are like, eh, it's it's

1754
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:00,480
rest of them are like, eh, it's it's
 

1755
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,750
rest of them are like, eh, it's it's
fine. So,

1756
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:03,760
fine. So,
 

1757
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,509
fine. So,
A1 and I1, let's address them

1758
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:09,519

 

1759
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,310

for truncation.

1760
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:14,320

 

1761
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,149

Actually, let's address them. Let's use

1762
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:16,159
Actually, let's address them. Let's use
 

1763
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,909
Actually, let's address them. Let's use
standard Hugo conventions

1764
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:19,919
standard Hugo conventions
 

1765
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,830
standard Hugo conventions
and also

1766
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:21,840
and also
 

1767
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,470
and also
and for truncation

1768
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:26,480

 

1769
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,029

going to

1770
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:29,039
going to
 

1771
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,430
going to
use standard

1772
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:31,440
use standard
 

1773
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,070
use standard
or longer titles

1774
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,080
or longer titles
 

1775
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:43,590
or longer titles
beyond the width.

1776
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:43,600

 

1777
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,590

And notice that here I tell it to update

1778
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:45,600
And notice that here I tell it to update
 

1779
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,430
And notice that here I tell it to update
spec plan and task as appropriate

1780
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:47,440
spec plan and task as appropriate
 

1781
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,789
spec plan and task as appropriate
because I want to make sure that this

1782
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:48,799
because I want to make sure that this
 

1783
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,630
because I want to make sure that this
change is properly reflected and

1784
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:50,640
change is properly reflected and
 

1785
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,590
change is properly reflected and
captured in the specification because as

1786
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:53,600
captured in the specification because as
 

1787
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,750
captured in the specification because as
I'm iterating with the AI, as I'm

1788
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:55,760
I'm iterating with the AI, as I'm
 

1789
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,750
I'm iterating with the AI, as I'm
working with the LLM on this tasks, I

1790
00:33:59,750 --> 00:33:59,760
working with the LLM on this tasks, I
 

1791
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,789
working with the LLM on this tasks, I
want to make sure that whatever

1792
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:00,799
want to make sure that whatever
 

1793
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,990
want to make sure that whatever
decisions I made, they're actually

1794
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,000
decisions I made, they're actually
 

1795
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,029
decisions I made, they're actually
encoded back into the spec. Now there of

1796
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:05,039
encoded back into the spec. Now there of
 

1797
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,029
encoded back into the spec. Now there of
course could be an easier way where I

1798
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:07,039
course could be an easier way where I
 

1799
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,869
course could be an easier way where I
can just go through these tasks and then

1800
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:08,879
can just go through these tasks and then
 

1801
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,990
can just go through these tasks and then
at the end of it say can you please go

1802
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,000
at the end of it say can you please go
 

1803
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,069
at the end of it say can you please go
and summarize this and introduce this

1804
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:14,079
and summarize this and introduce this
 

1805
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,310
and summarize this and introduce this
into the spec. But for now it's easier

1806
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:16,320
into the spec. But for now it's easier
 

1807
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,790
into the spec. But for now it's easier
for me to just look at this and as I go

1808
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:18,800
for me to just look at this and as I go
 

1809
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,190
for me to just look at this and as I go
through the process ask it to go and

1810
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,200
through the process ask it to go and
 

1811
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,950
through the process ask it to go and
just plug it in into the spec because I

1812
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:22,960
just plug it in into the spec because I
 

1813
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,790
just plug it in into the spec because I
know it's going to happen. So what means

1814
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:24,800
know it's going to happen. So what means
 

1815
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,589
know it's going to happen. So what means
in the for me in the future is that if I

1816
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:27,599
in the for me in the future is that if I
 

1817
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,510
in the for me in the future is that if I
decide to ever rebuild this book page

1818
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:29,520
decide to ever rebuild this book page
 

1819
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,750
decide to ever rebuild this book page
because I moved my site from Hugo to

1820
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:31,760
because I moved my site from Hugo to
 

1821
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,069
because I moved my site from Hugo to
some new static site generator that uses

1822
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:34,079
some new static site generator that uses
 

1823
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,149
some new static site generator that uses
quantum computing in the future, I can

1824
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:36,159
quantum computing in the future, I can
 

1825
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,230
quantum computing in the future, I can
just reuse the exact same spec and have

1826
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:38,240
just reuse the exact same spec and have
 

1827
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,589
just reuse the exact same spec and have
my past decisions be reflected in that

1828
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:41,599
my past decisions be reflected in that
 

1829
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,190
my past decisions be reflected in that
document. So I don't have to redo this

1830
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,200
document. So I don't have to redo this
 

1831
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,550
document. So I don't have to redo this
from scratch over and over and over

1832
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:44,560
from scratch over and over and over
 

1833
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,550
from scratch over and over and over
again because again I I look at the

1834
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:46,560
again because again I I look at the
 

1835
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,389
again because again I I look at the
specification as a living document that

1836
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:48,399
specification as a living document that
 

1837
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,550
specification as a living document that
encodes the specific feature capability

1838
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:50,560
encodes the specific feature capability
 

1839
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,109
encodes the specific feature capability
in this case our book list for my site.

1840
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:53,119
in this case our book list for my site.
 

1841
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,470
in this case our book list for my site.
It's completely detached from the

1842
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,480
It's completely detached from the
 

1843
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,990
It's completely detached from the
implementation of the site because I

1844
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:56,000
implementation of the site because I
 

1845
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,750
implementation of the site because I
could be using Hugo or I might not be

1846
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:57,760
could be using Hugo or I might not be
 

1847
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,150
could be using Hugo or I might not be
using Hugo. I might need to rewrite this

1848
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,160
using Hugo. I might need to rewrite this
 

1849
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,950
using Hugo. I might need to rewrite this
in a year or two or five or 10 and I can

1850
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:02,960
in a year or two or five or 10 and I can
 

1851
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,349
in a year or two or five or 10 and I can
use the exact same spec to get the exact

1852
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:05,359
use the exact same spec to get the exact
 

1853
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,510
use the exact same spec to get the exact
experience that I want. Even though that

1854
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:07,520
experience that I want. Even though that
 

1855
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,870
experience that I want. Even though that
experience might look a little different

1856
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:08,880
experience might look a little different
 

1857
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,430
experience might look a little different
or use different tooling underneath. So,

1858
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:11,440
or use different tooling underneath. So,
 

1859
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,510
or use different tooling underneath. So,
for now, we're going to wait for the

1860
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:13,520
for now, we're going to wait for the
 

1861
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,390
for now, we're going to wait for the
updates to propagate and get back to

1862
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:16,400
updates to propagate and get back to
 

1863
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,310
updates to propagate and get back to
coding in just a little bit.

1864
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:22,320

 

1865
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,430

do it.

1866
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:23,440
do it.
 

1867
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,069
do it.
>> Okay, it finished the work. It has a

1868
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:26,079
>> Okay, it finished the work. It has a
 

1869
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,829
>> Okay, it finished the work. It has a
bunch of changes here that we can take a

1870
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:27,839
bunch of changes here that we can take a
 

1871
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,630
bunch of changes here that we can take a
look at. So, if we look at the spec,

1872
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:30,640
look at. So, if we look at the spec,
 

1873
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,310
look at. So, if we look at the spec,
it describes some of the conventions. It

1874
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:32,320
it describes some of the conventions. It
 

1875
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,870
it describes some of the conventions. It
updated the file. Great. It has our

1876
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:34,880
updated the file. Great. It has our
 

1877
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,109
updated the file. Great. It has our
tasks. Yep. Book data. It's a Hugo

1878
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:37,119
tasks. Yep. Book data. It's a Hugo
 

1879
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,750
tasks. Yep. Book data. It's a Hugo
standard directory. Makes sense. Makes

1880
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:39,760
standard directory. Makes sense. Makes
 

1881
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,349
standard directory. Makes sense. Makes
sense.

1882
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:41,359
sense.
 

1883
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,069
sense.
Styling. Okay. Ellipses for long titles.

1884
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:44,079
Styling. Okay. Ellipses for long titles.
 

1885
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,829
Styling. Okay. Ellipses for long titles.
Yep. It it encoded the requirements that

1886
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:45,839
Yep. It it encoded the requirements that
 

1887
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,670
Yep. It it encoded the requirements that
we wanted. So, let's keep the changes.

1888
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:47,680
we wanted. So, let's keep the changes.
 

1889
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,710
we wanted. So, let's keep the changes.
This sounds great. Let me commit and say

1890
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:50,720
This sounds great. Let me commit and say
 

1891
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,069
This sounds great. Let me commit and say
initial spec changes because this is

1892
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:54,079
initial spec changes because this is
 

1893
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,990
initial spec changes because this is
what it is. We have our 26 files. We're

1894
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,000
what it is. We have our 26 files. We're
 

1895
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,349
what it is. We have our 26 files. We're
going to commit here to our branch.

1896
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:57,359
going to commit here to our branch.
 

1897
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,870
going to commit here to our branch.
We're going to publish the branch and

1898
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:58,880
We're going to publish the branch and
 

1899
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,710
We're going to publish the branch and
push it

1900
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:00,720
push it
 

1901
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,870
push it
not to production just yet because we

1902
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:02,880
not to production just yet because we
 

1903
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,150
not to production just yet because we
are not yet ready get these things out

1904
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,160
are not yet ready get these things out
 

1905
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,750
are not yet ready get these things out
the door. We need to we need to actually

1906
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:07,760
the door. We need to we need to actually
 

1907
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,270
the door. We need to we need to actually
get the implementation going. So we're

1908
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:09,280
get the implementation going. So we're
 

1909
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,990
get the implementation going. So we're
going to go here and now is the moment

1910
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:12,000
going to go here and now is the moment
 

1911
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,270
going to go here and now is the moment
of truth. We're going to run implement.

1912
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:15,280
of truth. We're going to run implement.
 

1913
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,710
of truth. We're going to run implement.
Going to be the most long riding command

1914
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:16,720
Going to be the most long riding command
 

1915
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,950
Going to be the most long riding command
here. And once I start this, there's no

1916
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:18,960
here. And once I start this, there's no
 

1917
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,550
here. And once I start this, there's no
going back. We're going to have this

1918
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:20,560
going back. We're going to have this
 

1919
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,109
going back. We're going to have this
book page whether we want it or not. So

1920
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:23,119
book page whether we want it or not. So
 

1921
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,829
book page whether we want it or not. So
there we go. Sonnet implement us the

1922
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:25,839
there we go. Sonnet implement us the
 

1923
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:31,720
there we go. Sonnet implement us the
book page.

1924
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:31,730

 

1925
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:37,829

[Music]

1926
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:37,839
[Music]
 

1927
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,430
[Music]
All right, let's take a look here. So

1928
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:39,440
All right, let's take a look here. So
 

1929
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,670
All right, let's take a look here. So
I'm going to keep the changes, right?

1930
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:41,680
I'm going to keep the changes, right?
 

1931
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,829
I'm going to keep the changes, right?
And it made a bunch of them. If you look

1932
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:43,839
And it made a bunch of them. If you look
 

1933
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,069
And it made a bunch of them. If you look
at the the diff, right? Right. So,

1934
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:46,079
at the the diff, right? Right. So,
 

1935
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,589
at the the diff, right? Right. So,
there's the menus. They change the

1936
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:47,599
there's the menus. They change the
 

1937
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,550
there's the menus. They change the
menus. Great. Here's the index. Yep.

1938
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:50,560
menus. Great. Here's the index. Yep.
 

1939
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,990
menus. Great. Here's the index. Yep.
Books has books.css

1940
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,000
Books has books.css
 

1941
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,470
Books has books.css
list, bookcard, a bunch of CSS files,

1942
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:56,480
list, bookcard, a bunch of CSS files,
 

1943
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,510
list, bookcard, a bunch of CSS files,
and updated our task list. But the one

1944
00:36:59,510 --> 00:36:59,520
and updated our task list. But the one
 

1945
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,030
and updated our task list. But the one
thing that it did not do is actually it

1946
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,040
thing that it did not do is actually it
 

1947
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,310
thing that it did not do is actually it
did not rebuild a theme. So, I'm going

1948
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:02,320
did not rebuild a theme. So, I'm going
 

1949
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,109
did not rebuild a theme. So, I'm going
to go ahead here in my PowerShell. And

1950
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:05,119
to go ahead here in my PowerShell. And
 

1951
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,790
to go ahead here in my PowerShell. And
remember, because this is iterative,

1952
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:06,800
remember, because this is iterative,
 

1953
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,550
remember, because this is iterative,
we're learning as we go, sometimes it's

1954
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:08,560
we're learning as we go, sometimes it's
 

1955
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,829
we're learning as we go, sometimes it's
going to produce things that are not

1956
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:09,839
going to produce things that are not
 

1957
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,190
going to produce things that are not
correct, and that's fine. So, we're

1958
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:11,200
correct, and that's fine. So, we're
 

1959
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,950
correct, and that's fine. So, we're
going to be seeing something go either

1960
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:12,960
going to be seeing something go either
 

1961
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,310
going to be seeing something go either
horribly wrong or extremely well. Only

1962
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:16,320
horribly wrong or extremely well. Only
 

1963
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,630
horribly wrong or extremely well. Only
those two options. So, now I'm going to

1964
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:18,640
those two options. So, now I'm going to
 

1965
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,870
those two options. So, now I'm going to
run CD. Actually, I'm already in the

1966
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:20,880
run CD. Actually, I'm already in the
 

1967
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,390
run CD. Actually, I'm already in the
folder. So, I can just do a Hugo server

1968
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:24,400
folder. So, I can just do a Hugo server
 

1969
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,990
folder. So, I can just do a Hugo server
now that we actually have the things

1970
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,000
now that we actually have the things
 

1971
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,270
now that we actually have the things
done and let's see what it produced.

1972
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:29,280
done and let's see what it produced.
 

1973
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,190
done and let's see what it produced.
Let's take a look at the actual outcome

1974
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,200
Let's take a look at the actual outcome
 

1975
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,349
Let's take a look at the actual outcome
of this experiment. The only way to do

1976
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:35,359
of this experiment. The only way to do
 

1977
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,870
of this experiment. The only way to do
this is to build the site with Hugo. So,

1978
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:36,880
this is to build the site with Hugo. So,
 

1979
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,950
this is to build the site with Hugo. So,
we're going to go here to the browser.

1980
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:38,960
we're going to go here to the browser.
 

1981
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,550
we're going to go here to the browser.
Gonna scroll all the way to the bottom.

1982
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:40,560
Gonna scroll all the way to the bottom.
 

1983
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,550
Gonna scroll all the way to the bottom.
We see the reading list which is kind of

1984
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:42,560
We see the reading list which is kind of
 

1985
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,870
We see the reading list which is kind of
like what we expected. We see currently

1986
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:44,880
like what we expected. We see currently
 

1987
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,710
like what we expected. We see currently
reading. Okay. Some of the things. All

1988
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:48,720
reading. Okay. Some of the things. All
 

1989
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,349
reading. Okay. Some of the things. All
right. Like I see books. I don't see

1990
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:51,359
right. Like I see books. I don't see
 

1991
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,270
right. Like I see books. I don't see
pages

1992
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:53,280
pages
 

1993
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,510
pages
and I don't see the grid. Right. So like

1994
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:55,520
and I don't see the grid. Right. So like
 

1995
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,990
and I don't see the grid. Right. So like
we we have this thing. We have the kind

1996
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,000
we we have this thing. We have the kind
 

1997
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,910
we we have this thing. We have the kind
of the the the data being populated

1998
00:37:59,910 --> 00:37:59,920
of the the the data being populated
 

1999
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,589
of the the the data being populated
based on the book data because if I look

2000
00:38:01,589 --> 00:38:01,599
based on the book data because if I look
 

2001
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,750
based on the book data because if I look
here and we look at the books tunnel, we

2002
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:03,760
here and we look at the books tunnel, we
 

2003
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,470
here and we look at the books tunnel, we
have a bunch of them, right? Which is

2004
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:06,480
have a bunch of them, right? Which is
 

2005
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,390
have a bunch of them, right? Which is
great. It means the data model is bound

2006
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:10,400
great. It means the data model is bound
 

2007
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,630
great. It means the data model is bound
to the page, but it doesn't render the

2008
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:12,640
to the page, but it doesn't render the
 

2009
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,069
to the page, but it doesn't render the
way we want. It does not actually

2010
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:14,079
way we want. It does not actually
 

2011
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,829
way we want. It does not actually
produce the grid. So, we're going to go

2012
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:15,839
produce the grid. So, we're going to go
 

2013
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,750
produce the grid. So, we're going to go
back to VS Code. We're still using Cloud

2014
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:17,760
back to VS Code. We're still using Cloud
 

2015
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,750
back to VS Code. We're still using Cloud
Sonnet 4. Actually, I think that's fine.

2016
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:19,760
Sonnet 4. Actually, I think that's fine.
 

2017
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,750
Sonnet 4. Actually, I think that's fine.
And we'll mention that we do not

2018
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:21,760
And we'll mention that we do not
 

2019
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,550
And we'll mention that we do not
actually have the grid. And then we're

2020
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:24,560
actually have the grid. And then we're
 

2021
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,990
actually have the grid. And then we're
going to continue to iterate. We're

2022
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,000
going to continue to iterate. We're
 

2023
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,030
going to continue to iterate. We're
going to tell the AI what to do to bring

2024
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,040
going to tell the AI what to do to bring
 

2025
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,829
going to tell the AI what to do to bring
this up to the style and format that we

2026
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:31,839
this up to the style and format that we
 

2027
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,349
this up to the style and format that we
want. And at the same time, we'll make

2028
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:33,359
want. And at the same time, we'll make
 

2029
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,270
want. And at the same time, we'll make
sure that all that is being encoded back

2030
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:35,280
sure that all that is being encoded back
 

2031
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,829
sure that all that is being encoded back
to the specification. So let's iterate

2032
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:37,839
to the specification. So let's iterate
 

2033
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:42,510
to the specification. So let's iterate
on this a little bit.

2034
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:42,520

 

2035
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,710

[Applause]

2036
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:43,720
[Applause]
 

2037
00:38:43,720 --> 00:39:03,430
[Applause]
[Music]

2038
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:03,440

 

2039
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,910

All right. So, we finished the

2040
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:05,920
All right. So, we finished the
 

2041
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,750
All right. So, we finished the
iteration. We've done quite a bit of

2042
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:07,760
iteration. We've done quite a bit of
 

2043
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,910
iteration. We've done quite a bit of
work and now I think it looks good. I

2044
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:09,920
work and now I think it looks good. I
 

2045
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,829
work and now I think it looks good. I
actually think that the work that's been

2046
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:11,839
actually think that the work that's been
 

2047
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,470
actually think that the work that's been
done here to iterate with Claude Sonnet

2048
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:14,480
done here to iterate with Claude Sonnet
 

2049
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,630
done here to iterate with Claude Sonnet
4 and GBD5 I, by the way, I switched

2050
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:16,640
4 and GBD5 I, by the way, I switched
 

2051
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,109
4 and GBD5 I, by the way, I switched
between them just to get it to land on a

2052
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:19,119
between them just to get it to land on a
 

2053
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,109
between them just to get it to land on a
good place. And like I said, sometimes

2054
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:21,119
good place. And like I said, sometimes
 

2055
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,109
good place. And like I said, sometimes
you have to just test different models.

2056
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:23,119
you have to just test different models.
 

2057
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,069
you have to just test different models.
Uh, it landed on this. So, I have my

2058
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:26,079
Uh, it landed on this. So, I have my
 

2059
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,750
Uh, it landed on this. So, I have my
reading list here. And I'm going to

2060
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:27,760
reading list here. And I'm going to
 

2061
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,510
reading list here. And I'm going to
again remove myself because you do not

2062
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:29,520
again remove myself because you do not
 

2063
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,430
again remove myself because you do not
need to see my face to see the design.

2064
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:31,440
need to see my face to see the design.
 

2065
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,790
need to see my face to see the design.
So, uh, it fits the design of my blog,

2066
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:34,800
So, uh, it fits the design of my blog,
 

2067
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,870
So, uh, it fits the design of my blog,
which is as expected. I wanted that to

2068
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:36,880
which is as expected. I wanted that to
 

2069
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,589
which is as expected. I wanted that to
be this way. We now have this section

2070
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:39,599
be this way. We now have this section
 

2071
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,430
be this way. We now have this section
for currently reading titles. And these

2072
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:41,440
for currently reading titles. And these
 

2073
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,790
for currently reading titles. And these
are obviously fake titles. I'm not

2074
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:42,800
are obviously fake titles. I'm not
 

2075
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,910
are obviously fake titles. I'm not
actually reading any of these books

2076
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:43,920
actually reading any of these books
 

2077
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,230
actually reading any of these books
right now, but it gives you an idea for

2078
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:46,240
right now, but it gives you an idea for
 

2079
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,589
right now, but it gives you an idea for
what it would look like. I now

2080
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:47,599
what it would look like. I now
 

2081
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,230
what it would look like. I now
introduced a badge here that says must

2082
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:50,240
introduced a badge here that says must
 

2083
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,310
introduced a badge here that says must
readad. So, for books that I think like,

2084
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:52,320
readad. So, for books that I think like,
 

2085
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,069
readad. So, for books that I think like,
wow, this is great. Everybody should

2086
00:39:54,069 --> 00:39:54,079
wow, this is great. Everybody should
 

2087
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,589
wow, this is great. Everybody should
read this. The books are going to be

2088
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:55,599
read this. The books are going to be
 

2089
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,270
read this. The books are going to be
labeled like that. So, we have this

2090
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:57,280
labeled like that. So, we have this
 

2091
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,190
labeled like that. So, we have this
consistent finished books headings with

2092
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,200
consistent finished books headings with
 

2093
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,670
consistent finished books headings with
a counter of titles and as well other

2094
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:01,680
a counter of titles and as well other
 

2095
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,150
a counter of titles and as well other
books. We have a nice rating display

2096
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:04,160
books. We have a nice rating display
 

2097
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,550
books. We have a nice rating display
here at the bottom. I love this just

2098
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:06,560
here at the bottom. I love this just
 

2099
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,630
here at the bottom. I love this just
stars and a counter the days when I

2100
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:08,640
stars and a counter the days when I
 

2101
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,150
stars and a counter the days when I
started and finished. And they're

2102
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,160
started and finished. And they're
 

2103
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,870
started and finished. And they're
presented in these nice little uh pill

2104
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:12,880
presented in these nice little uh pill
 

2105
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,550
presented in these nice little uh pill
format that I would expect from modern

2106
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:14,560
format that I would expect from modern
 

2107
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,310
format that I would expect from modern
websites. So, I I actually really like

2108
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:16,320
websites. So, I I actually really like
 

2109
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,069
websites. So, I I actually really like
this and I actually gave up on the idea

2110
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:20,079
this and I actually gave up on the idea
 

2111
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,390
this and I actually gave up on the idea
of pageionation. So this is something

2112
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:22,400
of pageionation. So this is something
 

2113
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,910
of pageionation. So this is something
that initially I was thinking about that

2114
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:23,920
that initially I was thinking about that
 

2115
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,829
that initially I was thinking about that
pageionation would be kind of nice but

2116
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:25,839
pageionation would be kind of nice but
 

2117
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,510
pageionation would be kind of nice but
then the more I thought about it the

2118
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:27,520
then the more I thought about it the
 

2119
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,790
then the more I thought about it the
more I realized like you know no I don't

2120
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:30,800
more I realized like you know no I don't
 

2121
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,230
more I realized like you know no I don't
think pageionation is actually what I

2122
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:32,240
think pageionation is actually what I
 

2123
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,630
think pageionation is actually what I
want because

2124
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:34,640
want because
 

2125
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,510
want because
I feel like for a lot of these scenarios

2126
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:37,520
I feel like for a lot of these scenarios
 

2127
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,069
I feel like for a lot of these scenarios
I'd rather get it on one page and

2128
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:40,079
I'd rather get it on one page and
 

2129
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,750
I'd rather get it on one page and
because I'm also using TOML and I

2130
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:41,760
because I'm also using TOML and I
 

2131
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,990
because I'm also using TOML and I
decided to go down the route of TML I

2132
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,000
decided to go down the route of TML I
 

2133
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,430
decided to go down the route of TML I
would have to implement some a bunch

2134
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:45,440
would have to implement some a bunch
 

2135
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,430
would have to implement some a bunch
custom JavaScript and I want to minimize

2136
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:47,440
custom JavaScript and I want to minimize
 

2137
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,950
custom JavaScript and I want to minimize
custom JavaScript on my site I want to

2138
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:48,960
custom JavaScript on my site I want to
 

2139
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,030
custom JavaScript on my site I want to
make sure that it just it's fast it's

2140
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,040
make sure that it just it's fast it's
 

2141
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,870
make sure that it just it's fast it's
flexible and it just runs as a static

2142
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:52,880
flexible and it just runs as a static
 

2143
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,390
flexible and it just runs as a static
site without too many JavaScript

2144
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:54,400
site without too many JavaScript
 

2145
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,390
site without too many JavaScript
dependencies. So that is the reason why

2146
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:56,400
dependencies. So that is the reason why
 

2147
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,829
dependencies. So that is the reason why
I just says you know what pageionation

2148
00:40:57,829 --> 00:40:57,839
I just says you know what pageionation
 

2149
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,589
I just says you know what pageionation
maybe in the future like I don't really

2150
00:40:59,589 --> 00:40:59,599
maybe in the future like I don't really
 

2151
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,589
maybe in the future like I don't really
care about it for now. Oh. Um, we have

2152
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:01,599
care about it for now. Oh. Um, we have
 

2153
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,109
care about it for now. Oh. Um, we have
this nice experience now. I can start

2154
00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:03,119
this nice experience now. I can start
 

2155
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,470
this nice experience now. I can start
populating this with books that I've

2156
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:04,480
populating this with books that I've
 

2157
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,430
populating this with books that I've
read. It look at how it did this job.

2158
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:07,440
read. It look at how it did this job.
 

2159
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,750
read. It look at how it did this job.
Like it I had the spec. It analyzed the

2160
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:09,760
Like it I had the spec. It analyzed the
 

2161
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,550
Like it I had the spec. It analyzed the
code base. It actually read the readme,

2162
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:12,560
code base. It actually read the readme,
 

2163
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,069
code base. It actually read the readme,
the styles, the theming. It

2164
00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:14,079
the styles, the theming. It
 

2165
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,630
the styles, the theming. It
contextualized that and bundled it into

2166
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:16,640
contextualized that and bundled it into
 

2167
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,710
contextualized that and bundled it into
the specification that I have here. And

2168
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:18,720
the specification that I have here. And
 

2169
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,950
the specification that I have here. And
then this is the output. This is the the

2170
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:20,960
then this is the output. This is the the
 

2171
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,950
then this is the output. This is the the
content here that I have uh that allows

2172
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:22,960
content here that I have uh that allows
 

2173
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,270
content here that I have uh that allows
me now to go and iterate in a way that

2174
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:27,280
me now to go and iterate in a way that
 

2175
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,950
me now to go and iterate in a way that
makes sense for this project. it makes

2176
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:28,960
makes sense for this project. it makes
 

2177
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,910
makes sense for this project. it makes
sense for this specific iteration of the

2178
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:31,920
sense for this specific iteration of the
 

2179
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,069
sense for this specific iteration of the
site. So, uh I'm very happy with how

2180
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:34,079
site. So, uh I'm very happy with how
 

2181
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,589
site. So, uh I'm very happy with how
this turned out and I still have my

2182
00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:35,599
this turned out and I still have my
 

2183
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,069
this turned out and I still have my
artifacts for my spec and plan. Uh and

2184
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:38,079
artifacts for my spec and plan. Uh and
 

2185
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,910
artifacts for my spec and plan. Uh and
as I mentioned, as I'm iterating on

2186
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:39,920
as I mentioned, as I'm iterating on
 

2187
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,270
as I mentioned, as I'm iterating on
this, one of the things that I should

2188
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:41,280
this, one of the things that I should
 

2189
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,150
this, one of the things that I should
absolutely do is encode the learnings

2190
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:44,160
absolutely do is encode the learnings
 

2191
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,910
absolutely do is encode the learnings
into the spec. So, we're going to do

2192
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:45,920
into the spec. So, we're going to do
 

2193
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,589
into the spec. So, we're going to do
this now. So, look look at what I'm

2194
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:47,599
this now. So, look look at what I'm
 

2195
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,910
this now. So, look look at what I'm
doing. So based on the conversation,

2196
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:53,920

 

2197
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,910

encode the learnings and the experience

2198
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:57,920
encode the learnings and the experience
 

2199
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,430
encode the learnings and the experience
pieces,

2200
00:41:59,430 --> 00:41:59,440
pieces,
 

2201
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,510
pieces,
not the technical details

2202
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:03,520

 

2203
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,910

into spec.md

2204
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:07,920

 

2205
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,470

for the current feature. That is

2206
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:10,480
for the current feature. That is
 

2207
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,390
for the current feature. That is
important because you have to make sure

2208
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:12,400
important because you have to make sure
 

2209
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,390
important because you have to make sure
that the learnings that you have been

2210
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:14,400
that the learnings that you have been
 

2211
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,790
that the learnings that you have been
working on are actually brought back

2212
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:16,800
working on are actually brought back
 

2213
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,309
working on are actually brought back
into the spec. And right now we're

2214
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:18,319
into the spec. And right now we're
 

2215
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,470
into the spec. And right now we're
iterating on one feature. But also keep

2216
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:20,480
iterating on one feature. But also keep
 

2217
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,990
iterating on one feature. But also keep
in mind that there might be multiple

2218
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:22,000
in mind that there might be multiple
 

2219
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,190
in mind that there might be multiple
features. So you might need to use

2220
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:23,200
features. So you might need to use
 

2221
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,270
features. So you might need to use
discretion as to how you're updating and

2222
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:25,280
discretion as to how you're updating and
 

2223
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,109
discretion as to how you're updating and
which spec because the LLM if you have a

2224
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:27,119
which spec because the LLM if you have a
 

2225
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,430
which spec because the LLM if you have a
library of seven or 10 or 20 different

2226
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:29,440
library of seven or 10 or 20 different
 

2227
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,829
library of seven or 10 or 20 different
specifications need to know which spec

2228
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:31,839
specifications need to know which spec
 

2229
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,190
specifications need to know which spec
to go and update. So you might want to

2230
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:33,200
to go and update. So you might want to
 

2231
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,190
to go and update. So you might want to
be precise here. But for now, because

2232
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,200
be precise here. But for now, because
 

2233
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,950
be precise here. But for now, because
this is just one spec on top of the

2234
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:36,960
this is just one spec on top of the
 

2235
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,870
this is just one spec on top of the
existing codebase, it's easy for me to

2236
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:38,880
existing codebase, it's easy for me to
 

2237
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,309
existing codebase, it's easy for me to
just tell it to just go and update the

2238
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:40,319
just tell it to just go and update the
 

2239
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,550
just tell it to just go and update the
spec based on uh the things that we've

2240
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:42,560
spec based on uh the things that we've
 

2241
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,069
spec based on uh the things that we've
iterated on. Let's see what it updated.

2242
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:44,079
iterated on. Let's see what it updated.
 

2243
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,390
iterated on. Let's see what it updated.
Right. So, uh focus on achieving visual

2244
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:46,400
Right. So, uh focus on achieving visual
 

2245
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,309
Right. So, uh focus on achieving visual
consistency and predictable behavior.

2246
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:48,319
consistency and predictable behavior.
 

2247
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,069
consistency and predictable behavior.
That is exactly right because initially

2248
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:50,079
That is exactly right because initially
 

2249
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,630
That is exactly right because initially
it created a whole bunch of UI that did

2250
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:52,640
it created a whole bunch of UI that did
 

2251
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,230
it created a whole bunch of UI that did
not quite look like the rest of the

2252
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:54,240
not quite look like the rest of the
 

2253
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,230
not quite look like the rest of the

2254
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:56,240
site. Design evolution iterative
 

2255
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,390

approach. Yep. Makes sense. Experience

2256
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:58,400
approach. Yep. Makes sense. Experience
 

2257
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,430

assumptions rather than pursuing

2258
00:42:59,430 --> 00:42:59,440
assumptions rather than pursuing
 

2259
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,150
assumptions rather than pursuing
theoretical completeness. Yes. So I

2260
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:02,160
theoretical completeness. Yes. So I
 

2261
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,790
theoretical completeness. Yes. So I
think a lot of this makes sense and what

2262
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:04,800
think a lot of this makes sense and what
 

2263
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,550
think a lot of this makes sense and what
we also want to do is from these

2264
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:06,560
we also want to do is from these
 

2265
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,710
we also want to do is from these
learnings because we we talked about the

2266
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:08,720
learnings because we we talked about the
 

2267
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,069
learnings because we we talked about the
experience learners and rational right

2268
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:10,079
experience learners and rational right
 

2269
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,670

like this is a section that got added

2270
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:11,680
like this is a section that got added
 

2271
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,309
like this is a section that got added
here and I've iterated on this before as

2272
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:14,319
here and I've iterated on this before as
 

2273
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,150
here and I've iterated on this before as
I told you I am encoding things in the

2274
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:16,160
I told you I am encoding things in the
 

2275
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,670
I told you I am encoding things in the
spec as I go so for things that exist

2276
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:19,680
spec as I go so for things that exist
 

2277
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,230
spec as I go so for things that exist
here so we have let's see six learning 7

2278
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:22,240
here so we have let's see six learning 7
 

2279
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,109
here so we have let's see six learning 7
8 9 10 12 14 typography and visual

hierarchy responsive and grid behavior

2282
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:29,680
hierarchy responsive and grid behavior
 

2283
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,910
hierarchy responsive and grid behavior
and what I can also do here is I I'll

2284
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:31,920
and what I can also do here is I I'll
 

2285
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,309
and what I can also do here is I I'll
keep the changes and let's transform

2286
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:36,319
keep the changes and let's transform
 

2287
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,230
keep the changes and let's transform
the learnings

2288
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:40,240

 

2289
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,589

into relevant functional requirements,

2290
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:45,599

 

2291
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,390

right? Because as I mentioned before,

2292
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:48,400
right? Because as I mentioned before,
 

2293
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,910
right? Because as I mentioned before,
the the goal of the spec is that it

2294
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:49,920
the the goal of the spec is that it
 

2295
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,829
the the goal of the spec is that it
becomes the executable artifact. If we

2296
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:51,839
becomes the executable artifact. If we
 

2297
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,910
becomes the executable artifact. If we
had a bunch of learnings that we went

2298
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:53,920
had a bunch of learnings that we went
 

2299
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,030
had a bunch of learnings that we went
through the process of iterating with

2300
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:55,040
through the process of iterating with
 

2301
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,470
through the process of iterating with
the LLM, we went through the process of

2302
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:56,480
the LLM, we went through the process of
 

2303
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,190
the LLM, we went through the process of
actually learning uh what the experience

2304
00:43:59,190 --> 00:43:59,200
actually learning uh what the experience
 

2305
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,349
actually learning uh what the experience
should look like based on the iteration.

2306
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:01,359
should look like based on the iteration.
 

2307
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,550
should look like based on the iteration.
We want to make sure that that is also

2308
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:02,560
We want to make sure that that is also
 

2309
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,349
We want to make sure that that is also
captured in the spec properly. So now we

2310
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:05,359
captured in the spec properly. So now we
 

2311
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,990
captured in the spec properly. So now we
have these functional requirements that

2312
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:08,000
have these functional requirements that
 

2313
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,910
have these functional requirements that
are embedded along with the initial set

2314
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:09,920
are embedded along with the initial set
 

2315
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,510
are embedded along with the initial set
of functional requirements that we had,

2316
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:11,520
of functional requirements that we had,
 

2317
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,270
of functional requirements that we had,
right? Because we remember we created

2318
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:13,280
right? Because we remember we created
 

2319
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,390
right? Because we remember we created
functional requirements when we first

2320
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:14,400
functional requirements when we first
 

2321
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,230
functional requirements when we first
started down the path of this feature.

2322
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:16,240
started down the path of this feature.
 

2323
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,950
started down the path of this feature.
And now we have some extras

2324
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
And now we have some extras
 

2325
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,550
And now we have some extras
that allow me to go and recreate this

2326
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:20,560
that allow me to go and recreate this
 

2327
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,550
that allow me to go and recreate this
things like system must use identical

2328
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:22,560
things like system must use identical
 

2329
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,630
things like system must use identical
header styling. This is great. You have

2330
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:24,640
header styling. This is great. You have
 

2331
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,470
header styling. This is great. You have
to have this in the spec. Maybe even

2332
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:26,480
to have this in the spec. Maybe even
 

2333
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,230
to have this in the spec. Maybe even
something that can be extracted and put

2334
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:28,240
something that can be extracted and put
 

2335
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,670
something that can be extracted and put
in the constitution because you want to

2336
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:29,680
in the constitution because you want to
 

2337
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,589
in the constitution because you want to
have consistent visual design. Must

2338
00:44:31,589 --> 00:44:31,599
have consistent visual design. Must
 

2339
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,270
have consistent visual design. Must
implement section counters with emoji

2340
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:33,280
implement section counters with emoji
 

2341
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,190
implement section counters with emoji
indicators. Yes. Yes. This exactly what

2342
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:35,200
indicators. Yes. Yes. This exactly what
 

2343
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,829
indicators. Yes. Yes. This exactly what
I did. Must use fixed width card

2344
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:37,839
I did. Must use fixed width card
 

2345
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,470
I did. Must use fixed width card
dimensions. Absolutely. I want that.

2346
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:40,480
dimensions. Absolutely. I want that.
 

2347
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,550
dimensions. Absolutely. I want that.
this is what what we did and media

2348
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:42,560
this is what what we did and media
 

2349
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,550
this is what what we did and media
queries screwed it out because cards

2350
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:44,560
queries screwed it out because cards
 

2351
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,630
queries screwed it out because cards
kept bouncing around, right? So like the

2352
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:46,640
kept bouncing around, right? So like the
 

2353
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,990
kept bouncing around, right? So like the
learnings that we had from this

2354
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:48,000
learnings that we had from this
 

2355
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,510
learnings that we had from this
experience need to be encoded back into

2356
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:49,520
experience need to be encoded back into
 

2357
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,750
experience need to be encoded back into
spec. So now if I go and delete the code

2358
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:51,760
spec. So now if I go and delete the code
 

2359
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,470
spec. So now if I go and delete the code
that existed for the the book experience

2360
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:54,480
that existed for the the book experience
 

2361
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,470
that existed for the the book experience
that I have here and I go and recreate

2362
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:56,480
that I have here and I go and recreate
 

2363
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,950
that I have here and I go and recreate
this, DLM should have a much easier time

2364
00:44:58,950 --> 00:44:58,960
this, DLM should have a much easier time
 

2365
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,550
this, DLM should have a much easier time
recreating the exact experience that I

2366
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:00,560
recreating the exact experience that I
 

2367
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,990
recreating the exact experience that I
wanted because I don't need to go and

2368
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:02,000
wanted because I don't need to go and
 

2369
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,589
wanted because I don't need to go and
reiterate all these conversations back

2370
00:45:03,589 --> 00:45:03,599
reiterate all these conversations back
 

2371
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:04,710
reiterate all these conversations back
and forth, back and forth, back and

2372
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:04,720
and forth, back and forth, back and
 

2373
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,030
and forth, back and forth, back and
forth. So there you go. This is how to

2374
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:07,040
forth. So there you go. This is how to
 

2375
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,910
forth. So there you go. This is how to
add a new feature to an existing code

2376
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:09,920
add a new feature to an existing code
 

2377
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,069
add a new feature to an existing code
project. I hope this has been helpful. I

am curious how you're iterating on your
 

2381
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,589
am curious how you're iterating on your
projects and what works and what

00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:15,599
projects and what works and what
 

2383
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,829
projects and what works and what
doesn't. And as always, we are expecting

for you. So, uh, keep us posted on how
 

2395
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,589
for you. So, uh, keep us posted on how
Speckit can be made better. Until the

2396
00:45:31,589 --> 00:45:31,599
Speckit can be made better. Until the
 

2397
