Hey friends, I am Dan Delamarski. I'm
one of the maintainers for SpecKit, the

00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:05,040
one of the maintainers for SpecKit, the
 

5
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,789
one of the maintainers for SpecKit, the
new project from GitHub. It's that

6
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:06,799
new project from GitHub. It's that
 

7
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,710
new project from GitHub. It's that
experiment that you've been hearing all

8
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:08,720
experiment that you've been hearing all
 

9
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,190
experiment that you've been hearing all
about on the YouTubes and the Tik Toks

10
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,200
about on the YouTubes and the Tik Toks
 

11
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,190
about on the YouTubes and the Tik Toks
and the Instagrams and wherever else.

12
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,200
and the Instagrams and wherever else.
 

13
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,790
and the Instagrams and wherever else.
But seriously, look at the numbers. Look

14
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800
But seriously, look at the numbers. Look
 

15
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,950
But seriously, look at the numbers. Look
at this.

16
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
at this.
 

17
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,109
at this.

opening pull requests. It helps

34
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
opening pull requests. It helps
 

35
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,310
opening pull requests. It helps
tremendously. And boy, do we have a lot

36
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
tremendously. And boy, do we have a lot
 

37
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,869
tremendously. And boy, do we have a lot
of stuff in store for you more around

00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
of stuff in store for you more around
 

39
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,350
of stuff in store for you more around
specit. But actually, that's the point

40
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,360
specit. But actually, that's the point
 

41
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,470
specit. But actually, that's the point
of the video. We're going to be talking

42
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:48,480
of the video. We're going to be talking
 

43
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,750
of the video. We're going to be talking
about specit today. We're going to be

44
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
about specit today. We're going to be
 

45
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,430
about specit today. We're going to be
talking and actually looking at how this

46
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
talking and actually looking at how this
 

47
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,670
talking and actually looking at how this
works. And by the way, like I'm also one

48
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
works. And by the way, like I'm also one
 

49
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,869
works. And by the way, like I'm also one
of those people that looks at these

50
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
of those people that looks at these
 

51
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,270
of those people that looks at these
issues fairly regularly. So if you have

52
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
issues fairly regularly. So if you have
 

53
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,910
issues fairly regularly. So if you have
any feedback, go and submit. Go and

submit your feedback right here in
GitHub. Open an issue. Uh do not open a

58
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:07,760
GitHub. Open an issue. Uh do not open a
 

59
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,350
GitHub. Open an issue. Uh do not open a
pull request that rewrites the entire

60
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
pull request that rewrites the entire
 

61
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,350
pull request that rewrites the entire
thing as an MCP server. I know I like

62
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
thing as an MCP server. I know I like
 

63
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,030
thing as an MCP server. I know I like
MCP. I'm going to reject that request

64
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
MCP. I'm going to reject that request
 

65
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,469
MCP. I'm going to reject that request
because you haven't talked to anybody

66
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
because you haven't talked to anybody
 

67
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,590
because you haven't talked to anybody
about this. So if you have any big

68
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600
about this. So if you have any big
 

69
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,789
about this. So if you have any big
changes, make sure you talk about this

70
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
changes, make sure you talk about this
 

71
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,350
changes, make sure you talk about this
first in the issue. And what is what is

72
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
first in the issue. And what is what is
 

73
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,749
first in the issue. And what is what is
the the issues that I see sometimes are

74
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
the the issues that I see sometimes are
 

75
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,789
the the issues that I see sometimes are
being open like Dr. D? What is this? I

76
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
being open like Dr. D? What is this? I
 

77
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,310
being open like Dr. D? What is this? I
mean serious. Yeah, do not do not open

78
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
mean serious. Yeah, do not do not open
 

79
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,990
mean serious. Yeah, do not do not open
issues. They just say DR like give me

80
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
issues. They just say DR like give me
 

81
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,270
issues. They just say DR like give me
give me some context for how we can

82
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
give me some context for how we can
 

83
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,469
give me some context for how we can
improve this. But anyway, so specit what

84
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
improve this. But anyway, so specit what
 

85
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,830
improve this. But anyway, so specit what
it is is a toolkit that helps you get

86
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
it is is a toolkit that helps you get
 

87
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,429
it is is a toolkit that helps you get
started with specri development. At

88
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
started with specri development. At
 

89
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,990
started with specri development. At
Microsoft, we are very big on spectrum

90
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,000
Microsoft, we are very big on spectrum
 

91
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,670
Microsoft, we are very big on spectrum
development lately. And one of the

92
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
development lately. And one of the
 

93
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,310
development lately. And one of the
things that we decided to look at is how

94
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
things that we decided to look at is how
 

95
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,109
things that we decided to look at is how
can we actually simplify the process of

96
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
can we actually simplify the process of
 

97
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,830
can we actually simplify the process of
you using spectrum development to build

98
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
you using spectrum development to build
 

99
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,350
you using spectrum development to build
real software. It's one of those

100
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
real software. It's one of those
 

101
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,830
real software. It's one of those
important things that you don't really

102
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
important things that you don't really
 

103
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,310
important things that you don't really
think about until you actually try it.

104
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
think about until you actually try it.
 

105
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,069
think about until you actually try it.
One of the conversations that I had

106
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
One of the conversations that I had
 

107
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,389
One of the conversations that I had
recently was around vibe coding, right?

108
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
recently was around vibe coding, right?
 

109
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,709
recently was around vibe coding, right?
Like you hear all these people that talk

110
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:06,719
Like you hear all these people that talk
 

111
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,430
Like you hear all these people that talk
about vibe coding some SAS app and

112
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
about vibe coding some SAS app and
 

113
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,110
about vibe coding some SAS app and
there's a lot of this imprecision

114
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
there's a lot of this imprecision
 

115
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,430
there's a lot of this imprecision
happening. You end up in these random

116
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
happening. You end up in these random
 

117
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,270
happening. You end up in these random
rabbit holes where the code is not quite

118
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,280
rabbit holes where the code is not quite
 

119
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,630
rabbit holes where the code is not quite
what you wanted. The implementation is

120
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
what you wanted. The implementation is
 

121
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,229
what you wanted. The implementation is
not quite what you wanted. The design is

122
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
not quite what you wanted. The design is
 

123
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,390
not quite what you wanted. The design is
not quite what you wanted. So spec

124
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
not quite what you wanted. So spec
 

125
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,750
not quite what you wanted. So spec
driven development is something that can

126
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
driven development is something that can
 

127
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,390
driven development is something that can
actually help you get out of that rabbit

128
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,400
actually help you get out of that rabbit
 

129
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,830
actually help you get out of that rabbit
hole into a little bit more of a

130
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
hole into a little bit more of a
 

131
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,910
hole into a little bit more of a
scalable solution for your software. So

132
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
scalable solution for your software. So
 

133
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,589
scalable solution for your software. So
uh let's take a look here. It's again

134
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:29,599
uh let's take a look here. It's again
 

135
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,270
uh let's take a look here. It's again
it's a GitHub repo. It's all open

136
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
it's a GitHub repo. It's all open
 

137
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,790
it's a GitHub repo. It's all open
source. It's free. You can take a look

138
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
source. It's free. You can take a look
 

139
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,309
source. It's free. You can take a look
at stuff that we have here. And uh, of

140
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
at stuff that we have here. And uh, of
 

141
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,750
at stuff that we have here. And uh, of
course, one of the things that I did

142
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
course, one of the things that I did
 

143
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,710
course, one of the things that I did
recently is push the specify CLI

144
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
recently is push the specify CLI
 

145
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,710
recently is push the specify CLI
reference spec kit includes this

146
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
reference spec kit includes this
 

147
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,869
reference spec kit includes this
wonderful thing which is called specify

148
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:44,879
wonderful thing which is called specify
 

149
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,430
wonderful thing which is called specify
CLI. It actually scaffolds things for

150
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
CLI. It actually scaffolds things for
 

151
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,270
CLI. It actually scaffolds things for
you. So if you're a developer and you're

152
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
you. So if you're a developer and you're
 

153
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,710
you. So if you're a developer and you're
thinking like, wow, what do I need to

154
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
thinking like, wow, what do I need to
 

155
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,110
thinking like, wow, what do I need to
get started with Spectrum Development?

156
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
get started with Spectrum Development?
 

157

CLI is right there. So you there's a

158
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
CLI is right there. So you there's a
 

159
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,070
CLI is right there. So you there's a
reference for it now as well. And uh I

160
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
reference for it now as well. And uh I
 

161
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,990
reference for it now as well. And uh I
use uvx and you can install it directly

162
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
use uvx and you can install it directly
 

163
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,710
use uvx and you can install it directly
from the GitHub repo because I have not

164
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
from the GitHub repo because I have not
 

165
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,670
from the GitHub repo because I have not

working on it. I saw that people already

170
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
working on it. I saw that people already
 

171
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,990
working on it. I saw that people already
filed issues on this which is great. But

172
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
filed issues on this which is great. But

releases and just download the templates
 

203
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,070
releases and just download the templates
yourself. We support several agents. And

yourself. We support several agents. And
 

205
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,390
yourself. We support several agents. And
just today, actually, I launched support

206
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
just today, actually, I launched support
 

207
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,149
just today, actually, I launched support
for Cursor. So, if you're one of those

208
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
for Cursor. So, if you're one of those
 

209
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,229
for Cursor. So, if you're one of those
people that uses Cursor, you're in luck.

210
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:52,239
people that uses Cursor, you're in luck.
 

211
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,390
people that uses Cursor, you're in luck.
You can use one of the releases here. So

212
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
You can use one of the releases here. So
 

213
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,070
You can use one of the releases here. So
we have a bunch of them. Uh there's for

214
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
we have a bunch of them. Uh there's for
 

215
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,750
we have a bunch of them. Uh there's for
example for copiloud, we have them for

216
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
example for copiloud, we have them for
 

217
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,830
example for copiloud, we have them for
PowerShell and shell scripts. There's a

218
00:03:59,830 --> 00:03:59,840
PowerShell and shell scripts. There's a
 

219
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,149
PowerShell and shell scripts. There's a
bunch of them that you will see shortly

220
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
bunch of them that you will see shortly
 

221
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,710
bunch of them that you will see shortly
in our demo. Uh depending on what

222
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
in our demo. Uh depending on what
 

223
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,990
in our demo. Uh depending on what
operating system you're running in. So

224
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
operating system you're running in. So
 

225
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,270
operating system you're running in. So
if you're running on Linux, you might

226
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
if you're running on Linux, you might
 

227
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,350
if you're running on Linux, you might
use bash scripts. If you're running on

228
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360
use bash scripts. If you're running on
 

229
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,670
use bash scripts. If you're running on
Windows, you might use PowerShell. No

230
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
Windows, you might use PowerShell. No
 

231
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,350
Windows, you might use PowerShell. No
judgment here. Use whatever fits your

232
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,360
judgment here. Use whatever fits your
 

233
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,710
judgment here. Use whatever fits your
scenario. But you can download these.

234
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
scenario. But you can download these.
 

235
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,189
scenario. But you can download these.
We're going to say grab the zip file for

236
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
We're going to say grab the zip file for
 

237
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,349
We're going to say grab the zip file for
the PowerShell script for uh our copilot

238
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
the PowerShell script for uh our copilot
 

239
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,270
the PowerShell script for uh our copilot
and put it into downloads. and we're

240
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
and put it into downloads. and we're
 

241
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,590
and put it into downloads. and we're
going to save it here. And let's go and

242
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
going to save it here. And let's go and
 

243
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,710
going to save it here. And let's go and
take a look at it. Let's open it.

244
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
take a look at it. Let's open it.
 

245
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,150
take a look at it. Let's open it.
And you'll notice that I have the

246
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
And you'll notice that I have the
 

247
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,390
And you'll notice that I have the
specify folder that has some metadata

248
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
specify folder that has some metadata
 

249
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,310
specify folder that has some metadata
for specify things like memory, scripts,

250
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
for specify things like memory, scripts,
 

251
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,070
for specify things like memory, scripts,
and templates. And scripts are, of

252
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
and templates. And scripts are, of
 

253
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,590
and templates. And scripts are, of
course, PowerShell because that's what

254
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
course, PowerShell because that's what
 

255
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,749
course, PowerShell because that's what
we downloaded. These are helper scripts.

256
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
we downloaded. These are helper scripts.
 

257
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,629
we downloaded. These are helper scripts.
We have some prompts in the GitHub

258
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
We have some prompts in the GitHub
 

259
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,710
We have some prompts in the GitHub
folder that we'll get to in a second.

260
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
folder that we'll get to in a second.
 

261
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,390
folder that we'll get to in a second.
So, you can just grab this, put it in

262
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
So, you can just grab this, put it in
 

263
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,830
So, you can just grab this, put it in
your project. You do not need to use a

264
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
your project. You do not need to use a
 

265
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,150
your project. You do not need to use a
CLI. I promise you, no installation

266
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
CLI. I promise you, no installation
 

267
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,870
CLI. I promise you, no installation
required. But installation actually

268
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
required. But installation actually
 

269
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,030
required. But installation actually
makes it much easier. So I do recommend

270
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
makes it much easier. So I do recommend
 

271
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,710
makes it much easier. So I do recommend
using it. I just copied the command and

272
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
using it. I just copied the command and
 

273
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,390
using it. I just copied the command and
I'm just going to go to the terminal,

274
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
I'm just going to go to the terminal,
 

275
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,629
I'm just going to go to the terminal,
zoom it in, and we're going to paste it

276
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
zoom it in, and we're going to paste it
 

277
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,950
zoom it in, and we're going to paste it
here. And I'm going to bootstrap a new

278
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
here. And I'm going to bootstrap a new
 

279
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,030
here. And I'm going to bootstrap a new
project. Let's see what is a thing that

280
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,040
project. Let's see what is a thing that
 

281
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,909
project. Let's see what is a thing that
we want to build today. And let's say I

282
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
we want to build today. And let's say I
 

283
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,629
we want to build today. And let's say I
want to build a podcast website. I am

284
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
want to build a podcast website. I am
 

285
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,150
want to build a podcast website. I am
big at podcasting. If you have not

286
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
big at podcasting. If you have not
 

287
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,390
big at podcasting. If you have not
listened to the work item, check it out.

288
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
listened to the work item, check it out.
 

289
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,629
listened to the work item, check it out.
But let's say I do not have a podcast

290
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
But let's say I do not have a podcast
 

291
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,070
But let's say I do not have a podcast
website and I want to build one for

292
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
website and I want to build one for
 

293
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,390
website and I want to build one for
myself. So naturally what I want to do

294
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
myself. So naturally what I want to do
 

295
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,950
myself. So naturally what I want to do
is just bootstrap the spectrum process

296
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
is just bootstrap the spectrum process
 

297
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,629
is just bootstrap the spectrum process
for the website. I'm going to call it

298
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
for the website. I'm going to call it
 

299
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,510
for the website. I'm going to call it
pod site and we're going to press enter

300
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
pod site and we're going to press enter
 

301
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,110
pod site and we're going to press enter
and wait for specify to launch. Now here

302
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
and wait for specify to launch. Now here
 

303
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,510
and wait for specify to launch. Now here
is where things get interesting. So we

304
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
is where things get interesting. So we
 

305
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,070
is where things get interesting. So we
have different options. I can choose

306
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
have different options. I can choose
 

307
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,390
have different options. I can choose
different agents for which I am

308
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
different agents for which I am
 

309
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,310
different agents for which I am
bootstrapping these custom commands,

310
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
bootstrapping these custom commands,
 

311
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,790
bootstrapping these custom commands,
custom prompts. Sometimes I use copilot,

312
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
custom prompts. Sometimes I use copilot,
 

313
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,270
custom prompts. Sometimes I use copilot,
sometimes I use cloud code. I'm not that

314
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
sometimes I use cloud code. I'm not that
 

315
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,230
sometimes I use cloud code. I'm not that
big on Gemini CLI and cursor, but I know

316
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
big on Gemini CLI and cursor, but I know
 

317
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,629
big on Gemini CLI and cursor, but I know
that other people use them. So, they're

318
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
that other people use them. So, they're
 

319
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,749
that other people use them. So, they're
here. You can use them through the

320
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:51,759
here. You can use them through the
 

321
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,150
here. You can use them through the
specify CLI. And because it runs in a

322
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
specify CLI. And because it runs in a
 

323
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,510
specify CLI. And because it runs in a
terminal, you can always just, you know,

324
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
terminal, you can always just, you know,
 

325
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,110
terminal, you can always just, you know,
navigate with your arrows, use your

326
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
navigate with your arrows, use your
 

327
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,029
navigate with your arrows, use your
keyboard, be comfortable with your

328
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
keyboard, be comfortable with your
 

329
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,070
keyboard, be comfortable with your
keyboard, and pick the agent that you

330
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
keyboard, and pick the agent that you
 

331
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,629
keyboard, and pick the agent that you
want. I'm going to pick copilot. Now,

332
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
want. I'm going to pick copilot. Now,
 

333
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,189
want. I'm going to pick copilot. Now,
I'm also picking the type of scripts

334
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
I'm also picking the type of scripts
 

335
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,830
I'm also picking the type of scripts
that I'm going to be using for my helper

336
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
that I'm going to be using for my helper
 

337
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,189
that I'm going to be using for my helper
system, right? Because when we're

338
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
system, right? Because when we're
 

339
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,270
system, right? Because when we're
running a bunch of these prompts, what

340
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
running a bunch of these prompts, what
 

341
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,309
running a bunch of these prompts, what
they're also going to do is they're

342
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
they're also going to do is they're
 

343
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,430
they're also going to do is they're
going to run a bunch of scripts that are

344
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
going to run a bunch of scripts that are
 

345
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,189
going to run a bunch of scripts that are
going to bootstrap things like get

346
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
going to bootstrap things like get
 

347
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,510
going to bootstrap things like get
branches and make sure that the uh JSON

348
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
branches and make sure that the uh JSON
 

349
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,990
branches and make sure that the uh JSON
content that we use to kind of link

350
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
content that we use to kind of link
 

351
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,790
content that we use to kind of link
metadata is the same. And for that, the

352
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
metadata is the same. And for that, the
 

353
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,150
metadata is the same. And for that, the
easiest way to do this is with scripts

354
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
easiest way to do this is with scripts
 

355
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,670
easiest way to do this is with scripts
because it's deterministic. You don't

356
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:29,680
because it's deterministic. You don't
 

357
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,510
because it's deterministic. You don't
actually have to rely on the LLM, the

358
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
actually have to rely on the LLM, the
 

359
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,189
actually have to rely on the LLM, the
large language model to go in and figure

360
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
large language model to go in and figure
 

361
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,510
large language model to go in and figure
out how to piece things together. Things

362
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
out how to piece things together. Things
 

363
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,950
out how to piece things together. Things
just work. So it defaults smartly to the

364
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
just work. So it defaults smartly to the
 

365
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,550
just work. So it defaults smartly to the
operating system that you're running in.

366
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
operating system that you're running in.
 

367
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,950
operating system that you're running in.
In this case, I have PowerShell selected

368
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
In this case, I have PowerShell selected
 

369
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,309
In this case, I have PowerShell selected
because I'm running this on a Windows

370
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
because I'm running this on a Windows
 

371
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,590
because I'm running this on a Windows
terminal. It's Windows PowerShell,

372
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600
terminal. It's Windows PowerShell,
 

373
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,990
terminal. It's Windows PowerShell,
right? But if I so desire, I can switch

374
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
right? But if I so desire, I can switch
 

375
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,909
right? But if I so desire, I can switch
to shell scripts. If you're running WSL

376
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
to shell scripts. If you're running WSL
 

377
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,710
to shell scripts. If you're running WSL
2 or maybe you have an Ubuntu VM or a

378
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
2 or maybe you have an Ubuntu VM or a
 

379
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,790
2 or maybe you have an Ubuntu VM or a
Fedora VM, you can use that there as

380
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
Fedora VM, you can use that there as
 

381
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,189
Fedora VM, you can use that there as
well. And by the way, this just launched

382
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
well. And by the way, this just launched
 

383
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,870
well. And by the way, this just launched
today. It's hot off the press. You can

384
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
today. It's hot off the press. You can
 

385
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,950
today. It's hot off the press. You can
actually now support PowerShell. You

386
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
actually now support PowerShell. You
 

387
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,110
actually now support PowerShell. You
don't need WSL 2 on Windows to run this.

388
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
don't need WSL 2 on Windows to run this.
 

389
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,950
don't need WSL 2 on Windows to run this.
You can just run it native Windows. I'm

390
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
You can just run it native Windows. I'm
 

391
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,390
You can just run it native Windows. I'm
going to select PowerShell, right?

392
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
going to select PowerShell, right?
 

393
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,990
going to select PowerShell, right?
Because that's that's what we want. We

394
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
Because that's that's what we want. We
 

395
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,390
Because that's that's what we want. We
want to run this on Windows as is.

396
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
want to run this on Windows as is.
 

397
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,150
want to run this on Windows as is.
PowerShell it is. And we'll see some

398
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160
PowerShell it is. And we'll see some
 

399
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,550
PowerShell it is. And we'll see some
status changes. This is basically the

400
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
status changes. This is basically the
 

401
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,629
status changes. This is basically the
specified CLI going and downloading a

402
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
specified CLI going and downloading a
 

403
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,870
specified CLI going and downloading a
bunch of stuff and extracting the

404
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
bunch of stuff and extracting the
 

405
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,110
bunch of stuff and extracting the
templates locally. As I mentioned

406
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
templates locally. As I mentioned
 

407
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,070
templates locally. As I mentioned
before, like this is just a convenience

408
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,080
before, like this is just a convenience
 

409
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,589
before, like this is just a convenience
layer. Like this is not something that

410
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
layer. Like this is not something that
 

411
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,029
layer. Like this is not something that
you have to do. You can just download

412
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
you have to do. You can just download
 

413
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,469
you have to do. You can just download
the zip yourself from the release for

414
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
the zip yourself from the release for
 

415
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,710
the zip yourself from the release for
the agent and the shell script type that

416
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:30,720
the agent and the shell script type that
 

417
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,390
the agent and the shell script type that
you want and extract it and put in your

418
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
you want and extract it and put in your
 

419
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,629
you want and extract it and put in your
project. Just as easy.

420
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:34,639
project. Just as easy.
 

421
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,950
project. Just as easy.
So now you'll notice that there are some

422
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
So now you'll notice that there are some
 

423
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,510
So now you'll notice that there are some
instructions here for me. I can navigate

424
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
instructions here for me. I can navigate
 

425
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,749
instructions here for me. I can navigate
to the folder. I can open in Visual

426
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
to the folder. I can open in Visual
 

427
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,469
to the folder. I can open in Visual
Studio Code and use some slash commands.

428
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
Studio Code and use some slash commands.
 

429
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,870
Studio Code and use some slash commands.
There are specify plan and tasks. These

430
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:46,880
There are specify plan and tasks. These
 

431
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,830
There are specify plan and tasks. These
are going to help me to actually

432
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
are going to help me to actually
 

433
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,189
are going to help me to actually
bootstrap my project. And I can update

434
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:51,199
bootstrap my project. And I can update
 

435
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,390
bootstrap my project. And I can update
the constitution file. The constitution

436
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
the constitution file. The constitution
 

437
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,749
the constitution file. The constitution
file is actually something that you

438
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
file is actually something that you
 

439
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,189
file is actually something that you
probably have not heard about before

440
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,199
probably have not heard about before
 

441
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,189
probably have not heard about before
because it's relatively new. the the the

442
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
because it's relatively new. the the the
 

443
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,510
because it's relatively new. the the the
idea of the constitution is that it

444
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
idea of the constitution is that it
 

445
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,830
idea of the constitution is that it
establishes a set of non-negotiable

446
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
establishes a set of non-negotiable
 

447
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,710
establishes a set of non-negotiable
principles for your project. So if you

448
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
principles for your project. So if you
 

449
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,029
principles for your project. So if you
have things like I always have to have

450
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
have things like I always have to have
 

451
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,510
have things like I always have to have
tests. I always got to make sure that

452
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
tests. I always got to make sure that
 

453
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,150
tests. I always got to make sure that
I'm running Nex.js of a specific

454
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,160
I'm running Nex.js of a specific
 

455
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,469
I'm running Nex.js of a specific
version, you encode that in the

456
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
version, you encode that in the
 

457
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,749
version, you encode that in the
constitution. That's where the stuff

458
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
constitution. That's where the stuff
 

459
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,189
constitution. That's where the stuff
goes. So this is where the constitution

460
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
goes. So this is where the constitution
 

461
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,950
goes. So this is where the constitution
comes in and it becomes super super

462
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
comes in and it becomes super super
 

463
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,790
comes in and it becomes super super
helpful for any of your projects. Uh now

464
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
helpful for any of your projects. Uh now
 

465
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,110
helpful for any of your projects. Uh now
we're going to jump back here to our

466
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
we're going to jump back here to our
 

467
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,869
we're going to jump back here to our
terminal and I'm going to launch VS Code

468
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879
terminal and I'm going to launch VS Code
 

469
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,390
terminal and I'm going to launch VS Code
because I'm going to be iterating on

470
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,400
because I'm going to be iterating on
 

471
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,909
because I'm going to be iterating on
this project inside VS Code of course

472
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:33,919
this project inside VS Code of course
 

473
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,829
this project inside VS Code of course
and we'll notice that the podsite here

474
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:35,839
and we'll notice that the podsite here
 

475
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,110
and we'll notice that the podsite here
and this is because I opened the wrong

476
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
and this is because I opened the wrong
 

477
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,430
and this is because I opened the wrong
folder and this is how I know notice

478
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
folder and this is how I know notice
 

479
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,350
folder and this is how I know notice
that I have podsite here and these are

480
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
that I have podsite here and these are
 

481
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,590
that I have podsite here and these are
the GitHub folders. But if I go into

482
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
the GitHub folders. But if I go into
 

483
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,470
the GitHub folders. But if I go into
agent mode and VS code here and if you

484
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
agent mode and VS code here and if you
 

485
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,350
agent mode and VS code here and if you
see if you start typing in /specify

486
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360

 

487
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,030

oh I can't type slsp specify right and

488
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,040
oh I can't type slsp specify right and
 

489
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,630
oh I can't type slsp specify right and
you will not see the command there that

490
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
you will not see the command there that
 

491
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,870
you will not see the command there that
means you're in the wrong folder you are

492
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
means you're in the wrong folder you are
 

493
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,269
means you're in the wrong folder you are
one level too high up from where you

494
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
one level too high up from where you
 

495
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,430
one level too high up from where you
need to be to do this we're going to

496
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
need to be to do this we're going to
 

497
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,310
need to be to do this we're going to
close VS go back to the terminal and

498
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
close VS go back to the terminal and
 

499
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,670
close VS go back to the terminal and
we'll go to cd pod site

500
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
we'll go to cd pod site
 

501
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,190
we'll go to cd pod site
that's why I put this instruction here

502
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
that's why I put this instruction here
 

503
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,430
that's why I put this instruction here
in green that you will see here in the

504
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
in green that you will see here in the
 

505
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,230
in green that you will see here in the
terminal. It's called cd podside. Go to

506
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
terminal. It's called cd podside. Go to
 

507
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,829
terminal. It's called cd podside. Go to
the folder to be able to use these

508
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
the folder to be able to use these
 

509
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,470
the folder to be able to use these
commands. So, we're going to go there,

510
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
commands. So, we're going to go there,
 

511
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,550
commands. So, we're going to go there,
right? And now we're going to launch

512
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
right? And now we're going to launch
 

513
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,269
right? And now we're going to launch
code from here.

514
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
code from here.
 

515
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,430
code from here.
Fantastic. Now, we're in VS Code. Now,

516
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
Fantastic. Now, we're in VS Code. Now,
 

517
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,430
Fantastic. Now, we're in VS Code. Now,
we see the GitHub folder and podsite is

518
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
we see the GitHub folder and podsite is
 

519
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,150
we see the GitHub folder and podsite is
at the root, which is fantastic. That's

520
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
at the root, which is fantastic. That's
 

521
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,630
at the root, which is fantastic. That's
exactly what I wanted. And now I see

522
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
exactly what I wanted. And now I see
 

523
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,710
exactly what I wanted. And now I see
that there is the GitHub folder with a

524
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
that there is the GitHub folder with a
 

525
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,870
that there is the GitHub folder with a
bunch of prompts. These are going to be

526
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
bunch of prompts. These are going to be
 

527
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,470
bunch of prompts. These are going to be
our slash commands. And slash commands

528
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
our slash commands. And slash commands
 

529
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,230
our slash commands. And slash commands
in VS Code is nothing other than custom

530
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
in VS Code is nothing other than custom
 

531
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,230
in VS Code is nothing other than custom
prompts. That's that's all it is. It if

532
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
prompts. That's that's all it is. It if
 

533
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,710
prompts. That's that's all it is. It if
you look at any of them, it basically

534
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
you look at any of them, it basically
 

535
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,190
you look at any of them, it basically
outlines a set of instructions for the

536
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
outlines a set of instructions for the
 

537
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,990
outlines a set of instructions for the
LM to follow to establish specific uh

538
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
LM to follow to establish specific uh
 

539
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,910
LM to follow to establish specific uh
conventions around what we're building.

540
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
conventions around what we're building.
 

541
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,070
conventions around what we're building.
So in our case, it requires running a

542
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
So in our case, it requires running a
 

543
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,230
So in our case, it requires running a
specific script. We see some

544
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
specific script. We see some
 

545
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,070
specific script. We see some
instructions for things to do. Use

546
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,080
instructions for things to do. Use
 

547
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,389
instructions for things to do. Use
absolute paths. It's nice. Same for

548
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
absolute paths. It's nice. Same for
 

549
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,190
absolute paths. It's nice. Same for
specify. Same for tasks. And we again

550
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
specify. Same for tasks. And we again
 

551
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,550
specify. Same for tasks. And we again
we'll see the purpose of these commands

552
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
we'll see the purpose of these commands
 

553
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,550
we'll see the purpose of these commands
just just in a second here. and also

554
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
just just in a second here. and also
 

555
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,389
just just in a second here. and also
have the specify folder. Again, shout

556
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
have the specify folder. Again, shout
 

557
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,590
have the specify folder. Again, shout
out to the community members who

558
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
out to the community members who
 

559
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,430
out to the community members who
suggested this because before if you

560
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
suggested this because before if you
 

561
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,949
suggested this because before if you
have like memory and a bunch of these

562
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
have like memory and a bunch of these
 

563
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,870
have like memory and a bunch of these
helper scripts and the templates, they

564
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
helper scripts and the templates, they
 

565
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,230
helper scripts and the templates, they
would just land directly in the

566
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
would just land directly in the
 

567
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,230
would just land directly in the
repository route, which is not super

568
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
repository route, which is not super
 

569
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,269
repository route, which is not super
helpful if you already have a project.

570
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
helpful if you already have a project.
 

571
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,990
helpful if you already have a project.
So, these simplify things a little bit.

572
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
So, these simplify things a little bit.
 

573
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,829
So, these simplify things a little bit.
So, you can just keep them inside this

574
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
So, you can just keep them inside this
 

575
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,829
So, you can just keep them inside this
specify folder. And if you so desire,

576
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:31,839
specify folder. And if you so desire,
 

577
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,590
specify folder. And if you so desire,
you can even get ignore it, which I

578
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:33,600
you can even get ignore it, which I
 

579
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,710
you can even get ignore it, which I
don't know why you would do that, but

580
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
don't know why you would do that, but
 

581
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,350
don't know why you would do that, but
you can. So

582
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
you can. So
 

583
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,750
you can. So
now that we have these baseline pieces

584
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
now that we have these baseline pieces
 

585
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,550
now that we have these baseline pieces
here, let's go ahead and use our slash

586
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
here, let's go ahead and use our slash
 

587
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,389
here, let's go ahead and use our slash
commands. I'm going to maximize the chat

588
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
commands. I'm going to maximize the chat
 

589
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,430
commands. I'm going to maximize the chat
box here. I'm going to use GPD5, but you

590
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
box here. I'm going to use GPD5, but you
 

591
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,949
box here. I'm going to use GPD5, but you
can also use different models. You can

592
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
can also use different models. You can
 

593
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,630
can also use different models. You can
actually experiment with different

594
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
actually experiment with different
 

595
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,870
actually experiment with different
models that exist in Copilot or any of

596
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:52,880
models that exist in Copilot or any of
 

597
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,430
models that exist in Copilot or any of
the agents that you're using to see what

598
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
the agents that you're using to see what
 

599
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,590
the agents that you're using to see what
output is better for the things that

600
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
output is better for the things that
 

601
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,910
output is better for the things that
you're building. The output will vary.

602
00:10:59,910 --> 00:10:59,920
you're building. The output will vary.
 

603
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,230
you're building. The output will vary.
So uh for example I like GPD5 and cloud

604
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
So uh for example I like GPD5 and cloud
 

605
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,550
So uh for example I like GPD5 and cloud
sonnet 4 personally but depending on

606
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
sonnet 4 personally but depending on
 

607
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,870
sonnet 4 personally but depending on
what you're building and the scope of

608
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
what you're building and the scope of
 

609
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,069
what you're building and the scope of
things that you're building you might

610
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:08,079
things that you're building you might
 

611
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,389
things that you're building you might
want to customize that and as I

612
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399
want to customize that and as I
 

613
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,910
want to customize that and as I
mentioned there's this constitution

614
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
mentioned there's this constitution
 

615
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,190
mentioned there's this constitution
document so if you go to memory and

616
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,200
document so if you go to memory and
 

617
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,110
document so if you go to memory and
there's constitution right now is just a

618
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
there's constitution right now is just a
 

619
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,030
there's constitution right now is just a
blank template but what we can do is

620
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
blank template but what we can do is
 

621
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,710
blank template but what we can do is
establish this constitution with the

622
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720
establish this constitution with the
 

623
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,630
establish this constitution with the
help of the LLM. So I'm just going to do

624
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
help of the LLM. So I'm just going to do
 

625
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,269
help of the LLM. So I'm just going to do
that uh and we're going to ask the LLM

626
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279
that uh and we're going to ask the LLM
 

627
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,590
that uh and we're going to ask the LLM
to go in and fill this out for us. So

628
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
to go in and fill this out for us. So
 

629
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,310
to go in and fill this out for us. So
fill the constitution

630
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
fill the constitution
 

631
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,110
fill the constitution
with the bare minimum

632
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120

 

633
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,310

requirements

634
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320

 

635
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,190

for a static

636
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
for a static
 

637
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,670
for a static
web app

638
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:47,680

 

639
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,269

based on a template because we want to

640
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
based on a template because we want to
 

641
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,190
based on a template because we want to
follow the template. the Constitution.

642
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,200
follow the template. the Constitution.
 

643
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,310
follow the template. the Constitution.
If you also look at this, these

644
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
If you also look at this, these
 

645
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,069
If you also look at this, these
principles and examples, it's all about

646
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
principles and examples, it's all about
 

647
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,949
principles and examples, it's all about
making it easy for the LLM to go and

648
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959
making it easy for the LLM to go and
 

649
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,470
making it easy for the LLM to go and
fill this out for you. This can

650
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
fill this out for you. This can
 

651
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,069
fill this out for you. This can
bootstrap it. It doesn't mean that you

652
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
bootstrap it. It doesn't mean that you
 

653
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,829
bootstrap it. It doesn't mean that you
cannot do this manually. It's more of

654
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
cannot do this manually. It's more of
 

655
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,470
cannot do this manually. It's more of
this bootstraps it for you and saves you

656
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
this bootstraps it for you and saves you
 

657
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,069
this bootstraps it for you and saves you
some time. So, we're going to press

658
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
some time. So, we're going to press
 

659
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,550
some time. So, we're going to press
enter here. Bare minimum requirements.

660
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
enter here. Bare minimum requirements.
 

661
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,590
enter here. Bare minimum requirements.
And we'll see what it comes up. We're

662
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
And we'll see what it comes up. We're
 

663
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,310
And we'll see what it comes up. We're
going to use GPD5. I GBD5 is good like

664
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
going to use GPD5. I GBD5 is good like
 

665
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,389
going to use GPD5. I GBD5 is good like
for these kind of things. If you use

666
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:16,399
for these kind of things. If you use
 

667
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,470
for these kind of things. If you use
things like sonnet, I see it go off the

668
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
things like sonnet, I see it go off the
 

669
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,910
things like sonnet, I see it go off the
rail sometimes and it does a bunch of

670
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
rail sometimes and it does a bunch of
 

671
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,110
rail sometimes and it does a bunch of
stuff and it starts editing the

672
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
stuff and it starts editing the
 

673
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,389
stuff and it starts editing the
constitution file and then it starts

674
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
constitution file and then it starts
 

675
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,670
constitution file and then it starts
creating more files it's going to refer

676
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
creating more files it's going to refer
 

677
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,430
creating more files it's going to refer
to. That's not what we want to do here.

678
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
to. That's not what we want to do here.
 

679
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,550
to. That's not what we want to do here.
So, I'm just going to rely on the

680
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:26,560
So, I'm just going to rely on the
 

681
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,829
So, I'm just going to rely on the
constitution. It's it's fine. And it's

682
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
constitution. It's it's fine. And it's
 

683
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,069
constitution. It's it's fine. And it's
going to look at the existing content

684
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:32,079
going to look at the existing content
 

685
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,990
going to look at the existing content
and existing template and I hope that

686
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
and existing template and I hope that
 

687
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,990
and existing template and I hope that
it's going to fill this out in the way

688
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
it's going to fill this out in the way
 

689
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,550
it's going to fill this out in the way
that I want to because if I'm going to

690
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
that I want to because if I'm going to
 

691
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,990
that I want to because if I'm going to
be writing this out manually here, it's

692
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,000
be writing this out manually here, it's
 

693
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,509
be writing this out manually here, it's
going to take us half an hour of this

694
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:41,519
going to take us half an hour of this
 

695
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,269
going to take us half an hour of this
video and nobody wants to watch me type.

696
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279
video and nobody wants to watch me type.
 

697
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,870
video and nobody wants to watch me type.
So we're going to give it another second

698
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
So we're going to give it another second
 

699
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,069
So we're going to give it another second
here. Um I've also noticed that GP5

700
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,079
here. Um I've also noticed that GP5
 

701
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,590
here. Um I've also noticed that GP5
sometimes can take a little bit longer

702
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
sometimes can take a little bit longer
 

703
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,910
sometimes can take a little bit longer
than sonnet. So sonnet this in the

704
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
than sonnet. So sonnet this in the
 

705
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,350
than sonnet. So sonnet this in the
context of copout is just going to start

706
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
context of copout is just going to start
 

707
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,509
context of copout is just going to start
iterating on this and just kind of you

708
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:57,519
iterating on this and just kind of you
 

709
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,670
iterating on this and just kind of you
will see the changes go gradually into

710
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
will see the changes go gradually into
 

711
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,389
will see the changes go gradually into
the files. GPD5 is a little bit more uh

712
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
the files. GPD5 is a little bit more uh
 

713
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,230
the files. GPD5 is a little bit more uh
I want to say thoughtful where it's

714
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
I want to say thoughtful where it's
 

715
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,829
I want to say thoughtful where it's
going to start thinking and thinking and

716
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
going to start thinking and thinking and
 

717
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,190
going to start thinking and thinking and
thinking and then just spit out the

718
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
thinking and then just spit out the
 

719
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,150
thinking and then just spit out the
whole thing for you which again can be

720
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
whole thing for you which again can be
 

721
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,150
whole thing for you which again can be
nice can be not so nice depending on the

722
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
nice can be not so nice depending on the
 

723
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,069
nice can be not so nice depending on the
scenario you're trying to tackle. So,

724
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:14,079
scenario you're trying to tackle. So,
 

725
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,389
scenario you're trying to tackle. So,
uh, pick your battles on the models you

726
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:16,399
uh, pick your battles on the models you
 

727
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,470
uh, pick your battles on the models you
want to use and try them out. The only

728
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
want to use and try them out. The only
 

729
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,430
want to use and try them out. The only
way to find out what produces the best

730
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
way to find out what produces the best
 

731
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,670
way to find out what produces the best
results here is through experimentation.

732
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
results here is through experimentation.
 

733
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,590
results here is through experimentation.
Just like spec kit, spec kit, the

734
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:25,600
Just like spec kit, spec kit, the
 

735
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,030
Just like spec kit, spec kit, the
spectrum development stuff that we're

736
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
spectrum development stuff that we're
 

737
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,190
spectrum development stuff that we're
shipping here is an experiment. We are

738
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,200
shipping here is an experiment. We are
 

739
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,790
shipping here is an experiment. We are
here to learn. I just want to remind you

740
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
here to learn. I just want to remind you
 

741
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,150
here to learn. I just want to remind you
that this is not a production scenario.

742
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,160
that this is not a production scenario.
 

743
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,069
that this is not a production scenario.
Like, there's a lot for us to learn. We

744
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
Like, there's a lot for us to learn. We
 

745
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,990
Like, there's a lot for us to learn. We
want your feedback. We want your input.

746
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,000
want your feedback. We want your input.
 

747
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,829
want your feedback. We want your input.
So if something breaks, if something

748
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
So if something breaks, if something
 

749
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,350
So if something breaks, if something
doesn't work, if something that it

750
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
doesn't work, if something that it
 

751
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,069
doesn't work, if something that it
produces is garbage, let us know. I want

752
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:44,079
produces is garbage, let us know. I want
 

753
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,590
produces is garbage, let us know. I want
to see that garbage. I want to

754
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,600
to see that garbage. I want to
 

755
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,670
to see that garbage. I want to
understand what worked and what did not

756
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:47,680
understand what worked and what did not
 

757
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,430
understand what worked and what did not
work because that will help us make it

758
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,440
work because that will help us make it
 

759
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,030
work because that will help us make it
better and by proxy improve the product

760
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040
better and by proxy improve the product
 

761
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,470
better and by proxy improve the product
for everyone else that might be running

762
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
for everyone else that might be running
 

763
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,110
for everyone else that might be running
in similar situations as you. So it

764
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
in similar situations as you. So it
 

765
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,030
in similar situations as you. So it
looks like GBD5 is still thinking. It's

766
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,040
looks like GBD5 is still thinking. It's
 

767
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,949
looks like GBD5 is still thinking. It's
going to update the constitution file by

768
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
going to update the constitution file by
 

769
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,750
going to update the constitution file by
updating by replacing the placeholders

770
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
updating by replacing the placeholders
 

771
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,069
updating by replacing the placeholders
with concrete static site requirements.

772
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,079
with concrete static site requirements.
 

773
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,470
with concrete static site requirements.
So, we're going to wait for it to finish

774
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:08,480
So, we're going to wait for it to finish
 

775
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,150
So, we're going to wait for it to finish
this process

776
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
this process
 

777
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,230
this process
>> a few moments later.

778
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,240
>> a few moments later.
 

779
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,150
>> a few moments later.
>> All right, looks like it finished. So,

780
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,160
>> All right, looks like it finished. So,
 

781
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,509
>> All right, looks like it finished. So,
I'm just going to keep the changes here

782
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
I'm just going to keep the changes here
 

783
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,949
I'm just going to keep the changes here
and let's take a look at what it

784
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
and let's take a look at what it
 

785
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,870
and let's take a look at what it
actually said. You know, no static first

786
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
actually said. You know, no static first
 

787
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,030
actually said. You know, no static first
delivery, no serverside execution. The

788
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
delivery, no serverside execution. The
 

789
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,910
delivery, no serverside execution. The
site ships HTML, CSS,JS, and static

790
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:23,920
site ships HTML, CSS,JS, and static
 

791
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,389
site ships HTML, CSS,JS, and static
assets via CDN. That makes sense.

792
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:26,399
assets via CDN. That makes sense.
 

793
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,189
assets via CDN. That makes sense.
Simplicity over tooling. Prefer vanilla

794
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:29,199
Simplicity over tooling. Prefer vanilla
 

795
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,670
Simplicity over tooling. Prefer vanilla
HTML, CSS,JS. I like that. I think that

796
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
HTML, CSS,JS. I like that. I think that
 

797
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,750
HTML, CSS,JS. I like that. I think that
makes sense. Accessibility and SEO

798
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:33,760
makes sense. Accessibility and SEO
 

799
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,230
makes sense. Accessibility and SEO
baseline also makes sense. Performance

800
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,240
baseline also makes sense. Performance
 

801
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,550
baseline also makes sense. Performance
budget, you know, I I I I don't

802
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:40,560
budget, you know, I I I I don't
 

803
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,310
budget, you know, I I I I don't
necessarily care for these things as we

804
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
necessarily care for these things as we
 

805
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,750
necessarily care for these things as we
are prototyping right now. For

806
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
are prototyping right now. For
 

807
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,269
are prototyping right now. For
production scenarios, you absolutely

808
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
production scenarios, you absolutely
 

809
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,949
production scenarios, you absolutely
should care about performance security

810
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:46,959
should care about performance security
 

811
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,470
should care about performance security
for now. I just do not want to deal with

812
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
for now. I just do not want to deal with
 

813
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,269
for now. I just do not want to deal with
that. Um, also things like requirements

814
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:53,279
that. Um, also things like requirements
 

815
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,870
that. Um, also things like requirements
here, development workflow, quality

816
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
here, development workflow, quality
 

817
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,310
here, development workflow, quality
gates. Um, yeah, this makes sense, but I

818
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,320
gates. Um, yeah, this makes sense, but I
 

819
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,750
gates. Um, yeah, this makes sense, but I
think like again for for what we're

820
00:14:59,750 --> 00:14:59,760
think like again for for what we're
 

821
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,949
think like again for for what we're
trying to do right now, this a little

822
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:00,959
trying to do right now, this a little
 

823
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,310
trying to do right now, this a little
bit a little bit too much. So, we're

824
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
bit a little bit too much. So, we're
 

825
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,949
bit a little bit too much. So, we're
just going to remove these pieces. And I

826
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:06,959
just going to remove these pieces. And I
 

827
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,710
just going to remove these pieces. And I
think a lot of the the three principles,

828
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
think a lot of the the three principles,
 

829
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,310
think a lot of the the three principles,
the three articles of our constitution

830
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
the three articles of our constitution
 

831
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,750
the three articles of our constitution
make sense. Static first delivery,

832
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:11,760
make sense. Static first delivery,
 

833
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,870
make sense. Static first delivery,
simplicity over tooling, and

834
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:12,880
simplicity over tooling, and
 

835
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,189
simplicity over tooling, and
accessibility, and SEO baseline, which

836
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
accessibility, and SEO baseline, which
 

837
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,110
accessibility, and SEO baseline, which
is good, right? So, now now we have a

838
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,120
is good, right? So, now now we have a
 

839
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,629
is good, right? So, now now we have a
constitution. Um, now I can use the

840
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
constitution. Um, now I can use the
 

841
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,870
constitution. Um, now I can use the
specify command that I talked about to

842
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:22,880
specify command that I talked about to
 

843
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,590
specify command that I talked about to
define the baseline specification. So

844
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
define the baseline specification. So
 

845
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,189
define the baseline specification. So
let's do that. Let's use slashsp

846
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
let's do that. Let's use slashsp
 

847
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,790
let's do that. Let's use slashsp
specify. And again, because I'm in the

848
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
specify. And again, because I'm in the
 

849
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,509
specify. And again, because I'm in the
right folder now, I see slpspecify slash

850
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:31,519
right folder now, I see slpspecify slash
 

851
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,389
right folder now, I see slpspecify slash
specify. And this is where I define like

852
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
specify. And this is where I define like
 

853
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,829
specify. And this is where I define like
a true product manager the what and the

854
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:37,839
a true product manager the what and the
 

855
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,389
a true product manager the what and the
why. We're not focusing on a technical

856
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
why. We're not focusing on a technical
 

857
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,750
why. We're not focusing on a technical
requirements. We're not focusing on

858
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:41,760
requirements. We're not focusing on
 

859
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,230
requirements. We're not focusing on
saying use Nex.js and this database and

860
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
saying use Nex.js and this database and
 

861
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,509
saying use Nex.js and this database and
so on so forth. Like we we don't care

862
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
so on so forth. Like we we don't care
 

863
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,269
so on so forth. Like we we don't care
about that at this point. This is all

864
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:47,279
about that at this point. This is all
 

865
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,910
about that at this point. This is all
about making sure that we are outlining

866
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
about making sure that we are outlining
 

867
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,470
about making sure that we are outlining
the motivation for the product and what

868
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:52,480
the motivation for the product and what
 

869
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,189
the motivation for the product and what
actually needs to be built. This is

870
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:55,199
actually needs to be built. This is
 

871
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,870
actually needs to be built. This is
helpful because for somebody reading

872
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:56,880
helpful because for somebody reading
 

873
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,550
helpful because for somebody reading
this, it is going to be completely

874
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
this, it is going to be completely
 

875
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,310
this, it is going to be completely
detached from the implementation. This

876
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,320
detached from the implementation. This
 

877
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,629
detached from the implementation. This
is important. The benefit of the spec

878
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
is important. The benefit of the spec
 

879
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,230
is important. The benefit of the spec
here is that it is completely detached

880
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
here is that it is completely detached
 

881
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,670
here is that it is completely detached
from the implementation. So if at some

882
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
from the implementation. So if at some
 

883
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,629
from the implementation. So if at some
point, you know, we're going to be

884
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:06,639
point, you know, we're going to be
 

885
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,110
point, you know, we're going to be
building this with Nex.js, but at some

886
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
building this with Nex.js, but at some
 

887
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,430
building this with Nex.js, but at some
point you switch to Hugo or any other

888
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:11,440
point you switch to Hugo or any other
 

889
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,670
point you switch to Hugo or any other
static side generator. You use the same

890
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
static side generator. You use the same
 

891
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,189
static side generator. You use the same
spec. The spec is written, the

892
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
spec. The spec is written, the
 

893
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,110
spec. The spec is written, the
requirements are there. You just toss it

894
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,120
requirements are there. You just toss it
 

895
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,030
requirements are there. You just toss it
into an LLM and ask it to write you

896
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,040
into an LLM and ask it to write you
 

897
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,269
into an LLM and ask it to write you
three, four, five, six variants based on

898
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
three, four, five, six variants based on
 

899
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,590
three, four, five, six variants based on
the same spec. So kind of neat. a side

900
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,600
the same spec. So kind of neat. a side
 

901
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,590
the same spec. So kind of neat. a side
effect of what what this is about. So,

902
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
effect of what what this is about. So,
 

903
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,790
effect of what what this is about. So,
we're going to go back here and use

904
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
we're going to go back here and use
 

905
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,150
we're going to go back here and use
specify and this is where I'm going to

906
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
specify and this is where I'm going to
 

907
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,030
specify and this is where I'm going to
say what my requirements are. So, I am

908
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,040
say what my requirements are. So, I am
 

909
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,749
say what my requirements are. So, I am
building a modern podcast website

910
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:37,759
building a modern podcast website
 

911
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,310
building a modern podcast website
to

912
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320
to
 

913
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,949
to
look sleek. We want to use the term

914
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
look sleek. We want to use the term
 

915
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,509
look sleek. We want to use the term
sleek. I I think the youths use this

916
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:45,519
sleek. I I think the youths use this
 

917
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,069
sleek. I I think the youths use this
term these days, sleek. I wanted to be

918
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:48,079
term these days, sleek. I wanted to be
 

919
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,629
term these days, sleek. I wanted to be
sleek. I um something that would stand

920
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:52,639
sleek. I um something that would stand
 

921
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,670
sleek. I um something that would stand
out

922
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680

 

923
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,870

should have a landing page

924
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:58,880
should have a landing page
 

925
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,030
should have a landing page
with one featured episode.

926
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
with one featured episode.
 

927
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,510
with one featured episode.
There should be an episodes page,

928
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
There should be an episodes page,
 

929
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,390
There should be an episodes page,
an about page,

930
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
an about page,
 

931
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,549
an about page,
and a

932
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
and a
 

933
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,309
and a
let's see an FAQ page.

934
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:16,319
let's see an FAQ page.
 

935
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,230
let's see an FAQ page.
uh should have 20 episodes

936
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,240

 

937
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,350

and the data is mocked. You do not need

938
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
and the data is mocked. You do not need
 

939
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:31,430
and the data is mocked. You do not need
to pull anything from any real feed,

940
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,440
to pull anything from any real feed,
 

941
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,350
to pull anything from any real feed,
right? So, we're we're just establishing

942
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360
right? So, we're we're just establishing
 

943
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,350
right? So, we're we're just establishing
the requirements. We're detaching

944
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,360
the requirements. We're detaching
 

945
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,029
the requirements. We're detaching
ourselves from the technical details.

946
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
ourselves from the technical details.
 

947
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,390
ourselves from the technical details.
We're not thinking about any technical

948
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,400
We're not thinking about any technical
 

949
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,590
We're not thinking about any technical
details. We're just saying like this is

950
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
details. We're just saying like this is
 

951
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,750
details. We're just saying like this is
what you're building. So, I think this

952
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:41,760
what you're building. So, I think this
 

953
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,110
what you're building. So, I think this
is good enough for me to start. Again,

954
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
is good enough for me to start. Again,
 

955
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,789
is good enough for me to start. Again,
for a real production scenario, the more

956
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:44,799
for a real production scenario, the more
 

957
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,029
for a real production scenario, the more
detailed the prompt, the better for us

958
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
detailed the prompt, the better for us
 

959
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,510
detailed the prompt, the better for us
because we're looking at this very

960
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,520
because we're looking at this very
 

961
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,830
because we're looking at this very
baseline context. Uh, we're just going

962
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
baseline context. Uh, we're just going
 

963
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,909
baseline context. Uh, we're just going
to use this and I'm going to use

964
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
to use this and I'm going to use
 

965
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,909
to use this and I'm going to use
specify.

966
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:55,919
specify.
 

967
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,230
specify.
And what's going to happen here is it's

968
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,240
And what's going to happen here is it's
 

969
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,190
And what's going to happen here is it's
actually going to go ahead and use our

970
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
actually going to go ahead and use our
 

971
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,350
actually going to go ahead and use our
prompt file, right? Like this is going

972
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
prompt file, right? Like this is going
 

973
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,110
prompt file, right? Like this is going
to use file instructions and specify

974
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120
to use file instructions and specify
 

975
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,150
to use file instructions and specify
prompt MD because that's the prompt file

976
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
prompt MD because that's the prompt file
 

977
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,750
prompt MD because that's the prompt file
that drives the slash command, right?

978
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
that drives the slash command, right?
 

979
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,190
that drives the slash command, right?
It's going to read the script that is

980
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
It's going to read the script that is
 

981
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,470
It's going to read the script that is
referenced there. It's very important.

982
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
referenced there. It's very important.
 

983
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,150
referenced there. It's very important.
It's going to read the spec template

984
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,160
It's going to read the spec template
 

985
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,669
It's going to read the spec template
that is going to be used as a baseline

986
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:15,679
that is going to be used as a baseline
 

987
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,590
that is going to be used as a baseline
because look, there's a templates

988
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
because look, there's a templates
 

989
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,430
because look, there's a templates
folder. And it's going to ask us if it

990
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:19,440
folder. And it's going to ask us if it
 

991
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,830
folder. And it's going to ask us if it
wants to run this PowerShell script. And

992
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:21,840
wants to run this PowerShell script. And
 

993
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,909
wants to run this PowerShell script. And
uh yeah, let's actually enable auto

994
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
uh yeah, let's actually enable auto
 

995
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,270
uh yeah, let's actually enable auto
approve yolo mode for the rescue. And

996
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,280
approve yolo mode for the rescue. And
 

997
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,110
approve yolo mode for the rescue. And
because I'm running this inside a VM,

998
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,120
because I'm running this inside a VM,
 

999
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,789
because I'm running this inside a VM,
I'm not really worried about this. I'll

1000
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:30,799
I'm not really worried about this. I'll
 

1001
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,830
I'm not really worried about this. I'll
just say allow run this command. It's

1002
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
just say allow run this command. It's
 

1003
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,950
just say allow run this command. It's
going to run a PowerShell script, a

1004
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:34,960
going to run a PowerShell script, a
 

1005
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,270
going to run a PowerShell script, a
helper script. Great. It switched to a

1006
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,280
helper script. Great. It switched to a
 

1007
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,150
helper script. Great. It switched to a
new branch because, as I mentioned, this

1008
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
new branch because, as I mentioned, this
 

1009
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,549
new branch because, as I mentioned, this
is git based. So as you're running this

1010
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
is git based. So as you're running this
 

1011
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,150
is git based. So as you're running this
in your project is going to be using

1012
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,160
in your project is going to be using
 

1013
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,750
in your project is going to be using
these custom branches to help you

1014
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760
these custom branches to help you
 

1015
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,990
these custom branches to help you
organize your work. That way you're not

1016
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,000
organize your work. That way you're not
 

1017
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,669
organize your work. That way you're not
damaging anything in production and you

1018
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:49,679
damaging anything in production and you
 

1019
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,350
damaging anything in production and you
can always roll back changes that you do

1020
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,360
can always roll back changes that you do
 

1021
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,710
can always roll back changes that you do
not like. Again side effect of the

1022
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
not like. Again side effect of the
 

1023
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,630
not like. Again side effect of the
spectrum process the fact that it forces

1024
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:56,640
spectrum process the fact that it forces
 

1025
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,789
spectrum process the fact that it forces
you to think about a lot of these things

1026
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
you to think about a lot of these things
 

1027
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,350
you to think about a lot of these things
where as you're experimenting and as

1028
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360
where as you're experimenting and as
 

1029
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,350
where as you're experimenting and as
you're iterating you not want to

1030
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,360
you're iterating you not want to
 

1031
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,630
you're iterating you not want to
interfere with the existing

1032
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:04,640
interfere with the existing
 

1033
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,150
interfere with the existing
implementation. Right? So the spec

1034
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,160
implementation. Right? So the spec
 

1035
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,909
implementation. Right? So the spec
establishes the baseline. You work

1036
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
establishes the baseline. You work
 

1037
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,150
establishes the baseline. You work
through it, you experiment, and then you

1038
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,160
through it, you experiment, and then you
 

1039
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,470
through it, you experiment, and then you
merge it into your main branch on an as

1040
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:12,480
merge it into your main branch on an as
 

1041
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,549
merge it into your main branch on an as
needed basis. So, looks like it's

1042
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
needed basis. So, looks like it's
 

1043
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,310
needed basis. So, looks like it's
reading some of the information from the

1044
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,320
reading some of the information from the
 

1045
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,029
reading some of the information from the
spec file that it helpfully created in

1046
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:19,039
spec file that it helpfully created in
 

1047
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,590
spec file that it helpfully created in
the specs folder. Uh, the file right now

1048
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:21,600
the specs folder. Uh, the file right now
 

1049
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,909
the specs folder. Uh, the file right now
is empty because it has not yet inserted

1050
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:23,919
is empty because it has not yet inserted
 

1051
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,430
is empty because it has not yet inserted
the template, but we'll see GPT5 soon

1052
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:27,440
the template, but we'll see GPT5 soon
 

1053
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,029
the template, but we'll see GPT5 soon
plug in all the required information,

1054
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,039
plug in all the required information,
 

1055
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:38,230
plug in all the required information,
which is going to be nice.

1056
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,240

 

1057
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,549

Wonderful. We now have a specification.

1058
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:40,559
Wonderful. We now have a specification.
 

1059
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,230
Wonderful. We now have a specification.
I'm going to keep it because I just

1060
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,240
I'm going to keep it because I just
 

1061
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,350
I'm going to keep it because I just
trust it that much. I I really don't

1062
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:45,360
trust it that much. I I really don't
 

1063
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,990
trust it that much. I I really don't
don't don't trust the LLM to do

1064
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000
don't don't trust the LLM to do
 

1065
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,669
don't don't trust the LLM to do
production software for you. Just check

1066
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:49,679
production software for you. Just check
 

1067
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,270
production software for you. Just check
it. You have to verify it. Check the

1068
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
it. You have to verify it. Check the
 

1069
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,830
it. You have to verify it. Check the
software statement that is being made in

1070
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:55,840
software statement that is being made in
 

1071
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,150
software statement that is being made in
the spec. So, uh we're going to look at

1072
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160
the spec. So, uh we're going to look at
 

1073
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,549
the spec. So, uh we're going to look at
the spec here. It created things for a

1074
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
the spec here. It created things for a
 

1075
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,029
the spec here. It created things for a
modern podcast website. Great. That's

1076
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:03,039
modern podcast website. Great. That's
 

1077
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,990
modern podcast website. Great. That's
that's what I asked it to do. Um let's

1078
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,000
that's what I asked it to do. Um let's
 

1079
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,590
that's what I asked it to do. Um let's
take a look here at quick guidelines

1080
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:07,600
take a look here at quick guidelines
 

1081
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,510
take a look here at quick guidelines
which is you know again it is the

1082
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,520
which is you know again it is the
 

1083
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,270
which is you know again it is the
guideline for the spec. We have to

1084
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,280
guideline for the spec. We have to
 

1085
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,110
guideline for the spec. We have to
respect them. The LLM has to respect

1086
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,120
respect them. The LLM has to respect
 

1087
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,430
respect them. The LLM has to respect
them. Focus on what users need and why.

1088
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,440
them. Focus on what users need and why.
 

1089
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,310
them. Focus on what users need and why.
Great. Um for AI generation all the

1090
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,320
Great. Um for AI generation all the
 

1091
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,310
Great. Um for AI generation all the
stuff that's again helpful baselines

1092
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:20,320
stuff that's again helpful baselines
 

1093
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,430
stuff that's again helpful baselines
that we need to maintain and respect. So

1094
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
that we need to maintain and respect. So
 

1095
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,590
that we need to maintain and respect. So
user scenarios and testing. All right.

1096
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:25,600
user scenarios and testing. All right.
 

1097
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,669
user scenarios and testing. All right.
There's some user stories and this if

1098
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:27,679
There's some user stories and this if
 

1099
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,750
There's some user stories and this if
you're a PM this will sound mighty

1100
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
you're a PM this will sound mighty
 

1101
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,510
you're a PM this will sound mighty
familiar. We have some acceptance

1102
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,520
familiar. We have some acceptance
 

1103
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,390
familiar. We have some acceptance
scenarios. We have some edge cases,

1104
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:34,400
scenarios. We have some edge cases,
 

1105
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,310
scenarios. We have some edge cases,
right? Like it accounted for things like

1106
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
right? Like it accounted for things like
 

1107
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,630
right? Like it accounted for things like
epsert ordering not specified and so on

1108
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
epsert ordering not specified and so on
 

1109
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,310
epsert ordering not specified and so on
so forth. There's also a bunch of

1110
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,320
so forth. There's also a bunch of
 

1111
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,029
so forth. There's also a bunch of
functional requirements that are also if

1112
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:43,039
functional requirements that are also if
 

1113
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,230
functional requirements that are also if
you're a PM, you know, functional

1114
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240
you're a PM, you know, functional
 

1115
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,830
you're a PM, you know, functional
requirements, they go into the spec.

1116
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:45,840
requirements, they go into the spec.
 

1117
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,230
requirements, they go into the spec.
This is, you know, it's done for you.

1118
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,240
This is, you know, it's done for you.
 

1119
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,310
This is, you know, it's done for you.
Um, there's a bunch of things that are

1120
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,320
Um, there's a bunch of things that are
 

1121
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,630
Um, there's a bunch of things that are
here, but also notice that there's a

1122
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:52,640
here, but also notice that there's a
 

1123
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,350
here, but also notice that there's a
review and acceptance checklist. This is

1124
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,360
review and acceptance checklist. This is
 

1125
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,430
review and acceptance checklist. This is
key here. I cannot emphasize this

1126
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440
key here. I cannot emphasize this
 

1127
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,350
key here. I cannot emphasize this
enough. If you are having a

1128
00:20:59,350 --> 00:20:59,360
enough. If you are having a
 

1129
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,510
enough. If you are having a
specification, if you're writing a spec,

1130
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:01,520
specification, if you're writing a spec,
 

1131
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,350
specification, if you're writing a spec,
you got to make sure that you have an

1132
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
you got to make sure that you have an
 

1133
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,830
you got to make sure that you have an
acceptance checklist and you got to make

1134
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:05,840
acceptance checklist and you got to make
 

1135
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,270
acceptance checklist and you got to make
sure that the acceptance checklist is

1136
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,280
sure that the acceptance checklist is
 

1137
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,510
sure that the acceptance checklist is
actually filled out. So things like no

1138
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:09,520
actually filled out. So things like no
 

1139
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,710
actually filled out. So things like no
implementation details, right? Like

1140
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:10,720
implementation details, right? Like
 

1141
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,310
implementation details, right? Like
languages, frames, APIs because that's

1142
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,320
languages, frames, APIs because that's
 

1143
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,310
languages, frames, APIs because that's
not what we're focusing on. We are

1144
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,320
not what we're focusing on. We are
 

1145
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,470
not what we're focusing on. We are
focusing on the what and the why, not on

1146
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480
focusing on the what and the why, not on
 

1147
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,270
focusing on the what and the why, not on
the how. Uh I also have details about,

1148
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,280
the how. Uh I also have details about,
 

1149
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,870
the how. Uh I also have details about,
you know, nontechnical stakeholders,

1150
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:20,880
you know, nontechnical stakeholders,
 

1151
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,510
you know, nontechnical stakeholders,
mandatory sections completed. One thing

1152
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:23,520
mandatory sections completed. One thing
 

1153
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,590
mandatory sections completed. One thing
that is not checked is no needs

1154
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:25,600
that is not checked is no needs
 

1155
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,430
that is not checked is no needs
clarification. And that is actually

1156
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,440
clarification. And that is actually
 

1157
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,630
clarification. And that is actually
something that is missing here right now

1158
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
something that is missing here right now
 

1159
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,149
something that is missing here right now
because if you look at there's items

1160
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:30,159
because if you look at there's items
 

1161
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,990
because if you look at there's items
that needs clarification like episode

1162
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
that needs clarification like episode
 

1163
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,510
that needs clarification like episode
list ordering should be reverse

1164
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:33,520
list ordering should be reverse
 

1165
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,310
list ordering should be reverse
chronological newest first confirm order

1166
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,320
chronological newest first confirm order
 

1167
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,470
chronological newest first confirm order
requirement. Now because we're

1168
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480
requirement. Now because we're
 

1169
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,909
requirement. Now because we're
prototyping and because we're

1170
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:39,919
prototyping and because we're
 

1171
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,870
prototyping and because we're
experimenting with this I can ask the

1172
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:42,880
experimenting with this I can ask the
 

1173
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,830
experimenting with this I can ask the
LLM to take a best guess. So we're just

1174
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:45,840
LLM to take a best guess. So we're just
 

1175
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,310
LLM to take a best guess. So we're just
going to do that for things that need

1176
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,320
going to do that for things that need
 

1177
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,870
going to do that for things that need
clarification.

1178
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:50,880
clarification.
 

1179
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,630
clarification.
Use the best guess you think is

1180
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:54,640
Use the best guess you think is
 

1181
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,430
Use the best guess you think is
reasonable.

1182
00:21:59,430 --> 00:21:59,440

 

1183
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,190

Update

1184
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,200
Update
 

1185
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,830
Update
acceptance checklist

1186
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:03,840
acceptance checklist
 

1187
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,470
acceptance checklist
after.

1188
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,480
after.
 

1189
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,909
after.
And we're going to have the LM basically

1190
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:07,919
And we're going to have the LM basically
 

1191
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,149
And we're going to have the LM basically
fill this out for us because I do not

1192
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
fill this out for us because I do not
 

1193
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,990
fill this out for us because I do not
want you to think about this prototype.

1194
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,000
want you to think about this prototype.
 

1195
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,710
want you to think about this prototype.
I just wanted to kind of vibe code, I

1196
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:14,720
I just wanted to kind of vibe code, I
 

1197
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,310
I just wanted to kind of vibe code, I
guess, but it's not really vibe coding

1198
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,320
guess, but it's not really vibe coding
 

1199
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,470
guess, but it's not really vibe coding
because I I am structuring this a little

1200
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
because I I am structuring this a little
 

1201
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,350
because I I am structuring this a little
bit better than just vibe coding. So

1202
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,360
bit better than just vibe coding. So
 

1203
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,750
bit better than just vibe coding. So
once the spec is established, mind you

1204
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
once the spec is established, mind you
 

1205
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,350
once the spec is established, mind you
this is very easy to share with your

1206
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:25,360
this is very easy to share with your
 

1207
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,789
this is very easy to share with your
team. So if somebody comes in and says

1208
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:26,799
team. So if somebody comes in and says
 

1209
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,870
team. So if somebody comes in and says
how did you build this website, look at

1210
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:28,880
how did you build this website, look at
 

1211
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,430
how did you build this website, look at
the spec, look at the rationale. You as

1212
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,440
the spec, look at the rationale. You as
 

1213
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,909
the spec, look at the rationale. You as
a human in the loop can go in and edit

1214
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:33,919
a human in the loop can go in and edit
 

1215
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,750
a human in the loop can go in and edit
this. People make the mistake of

1216
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,760
this. People make the mistake of
 

1217
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,990
this. People make the mistake of
thinking that oh the LM produced this. I

1218
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,000
thinking that oh the LM produced this. I
 

1219
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,990
thinking that oh the LM produced this. I
can only manage this with ALM. No, it's

1220
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,000
can only manage this with ALM. No, it's
 

1221
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,510
can only manage this with ALM. No, it's
a markdown file. Go in with your hands

1222
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:43,520
a markdown file. Go in with your hands
 

1223
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,190
a markdown file. Go in with your hands
and start typing and entering

1224
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,200
and start typing and entering
 

1225
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,190
and start typing and entering
requirements that you feel are, you

1226
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,200
requirements that you feel are, you
 

1227
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,990
requirements that you feel are, you
know, required for your product. So if

1228
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
know, required for your product. So if
 

1229
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,070
know, required for your product. So if
you feel strongly that the landing page

1230
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,080
you feel strongly that the landing page
 

1231
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,789
you feel strongly that the landing page
should have a logo centered at the very

1232
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:54,799
should have a logo centered at the very
 

1233
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,909
should have a logo centered at the very
very middle and some gradient that looks

1234
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:57,919
very middle and some gradient that looks
 

1235
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,230
very middle and some gradient that looks
like a rainbow, you absolutely can do

1236
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,240
like a rainbow, you absolutely can do
 

1237
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,149
like a rainbow, you absolutely can do
just go and add another functional

1238
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
just go and add another functional
 

1239
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,510
just go and add another functional
requirement that you can do this

1240
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:03,520
requirement that you can do this
 

1241
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,950
requirement that you can do this
manually. You don't need to ask the LM

1242
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:04,960
manually. You don't need to ask the LM
 

1243
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,630
manually. You don't need to ask the LM
to do this. Um again and this is

1244
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:06,640
to do this. Um again and this is
 

1245
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,990
to do this. Um again and this is
especially important if you're running

1246
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,000
especially important if you're running
 

1247
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,669
especially important if you're running
into you know enterprise environments or

1248
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:09,679
into you know enterprise environments or
 

1249
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,110
into you know enterprise environments or
environments where it's more controlled

1250
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,120
environments where it's more controlled
 

1251
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,029
environments where it's more controlled
where you need to actually add specific

1252
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:13,039
where you need to actually add specific
 

1253
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,789
where you need to actually add specific
requirements. Sometimes the LLM cannot

1254
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:14,799
requirements. Sometimes the LLM cannot
 

1255
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,029
requirements. Sometimes the LLM cannot
guess for you which it's fine. you know,

1256
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,039
guess for you which it's fine. you know,
 

1257
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,190
guess for you which it's fine. you know,
manual work is still there and we as

1258
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:19,200
manual work is still there and we as
 

1259
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,270
manual work is still there and we as
developers need to go in and do that

1260
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,280
developers need to go in and do that
 

1261
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,270
developers need to go in and do that
from time to time. So, we're just going

1262
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,280
from time to time. So, we're just going
 

1263
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,390
from time to time. So, we're just going
to wait for GBD5 here to think a little

1264
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
to wait for GBD5 here to think a little
 

1265
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,110
to wait for GBD5 here to think a little
bit and

1266
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,120
bit and
 

1267
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:43,029
bit and
fill out our clarification items.

1268
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:43,039

 

1269
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,390

We now have the updated checklist. uh

1270
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:46,400
We now have the updated checklist. uh
 

1271
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,710
We now have the updated checklist. uh
allegedly. So let's scroll back here. So

1272
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:48,720
allegedly. So let's scroll back here. So
 

1273
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,190
allegedly. So let's scroll back here. So
all right, looks like we're good. No

1274
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,200
all right, looks like we're good. No
 

1275
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,190
all right, looks like we're good. No
needs clarification anywhere in the

1276
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,200
needs clarification anywhere in the
 

1277
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,590
needs clarification anywhere in the
code, which is our spec. It's not

1278
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:55,600
code, which is our spec. It's not
 

1279
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,590
code, which is our spec. It's not
actually code. It's a markdown file.

1280
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,600
actually code. It's a markdown file.
 

1281
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,590
actually code. It's a markdown file.
We're going to look here. It looks

1282
00:23:59,590 --> 00:23:59,600
We're going to look here. It looks
 

1283
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,990
We're going to look here. It looks
great. I think we're ready to go to the

1284
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,000
great. I think we're ready to go to the
 

1285
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,430
great. I think we're ready to go to the
next step. The next step is we're going

1286
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:03,440
next step. The next step is we're going
 

1287
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,909
next step. The next step is we're going
to be using the slash plan command. And

1288
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:05,919
to be using the slash plan command. And
 

1289
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,830
to be using the slash plan command. And
this is where we actually specify the

1290
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:07,840
this is where we actually specify the
 

1291
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,350
this is where we actually specify the
technical requirements. So I'm going to

1292
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,360
technical requirements. So I'm going to
 

1293
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,669
technical requirements. So I'm going to
use

1294
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679
use
 

1295
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,830
use
next.js JS

1296
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:13,840
next.js JS
 

1297
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,789
next.js JS
with static site

1298
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799
with static site
 

1299
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,110
with static site
configuration.

1300
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,120
configuration.
 

1301
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:29,269
configuration.
No databases

1302
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:29,279

 

1303
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,789

and what to make sure that the site is

1304
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:30,799
and what to make sure that the site is
 

1305
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,310
and what to make sure that the site is
responsive

1306
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,320

 

1307
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,510

and ready for mobile because 2025 we

1308
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:39,520
and ready for mobile because 2025 we
 

1309
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,909
and ready for mobile because 2025 we
still have mobile phones. we need them.

1310
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919
still have mobile phones. we need them.
 

1311
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,990
still have mobile phones. we need them.
So this is good. It gives us a baseline

1312
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,000
So this is good. It gives us a baseline
 

1313
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,350
So this is good. It gives us a baseline
for what to think about. So we're going

1314
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:45,360
for what to think about. So we're going
 

1315
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,870
for what to think about. So we're going
to use again the plan prompt. It's going

1316
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:46,880
to use again the plan prompt. It's going
 

1317
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,110
to use again the plan prompt. It's going
to run some helper scripts as well. So

1318
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
to run some helper scripts as well. So
 

1319
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,029
to run some helper scripts as well. So
we do need access to the terminal here

1320
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:51,039
we do need access to the terminal here
 

1321
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,870
we do need access to the terminal here
in VS Code or whatever agent you're

1322
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
in VS Code or whatever agent you're
 

1323
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,070
in VS Code or whatever agent you're
using. If you're using cloud code, we're

1324
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
using. If you're using cloud code, we're
 

1325
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,350
using. If you're using cloud code, we're
just going to use cloud code because

1326
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:55,360
just going to use cloud code because
 

1327
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,430
just going to use cloud code because
cloud code is very good about running

1328
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,440
cloud code is very good about running
 

1329
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,269
cloud code is very good about running
things directly in your terminal. So

1330
00:24:59,269 --> 00:24:59,279
things directly in your terminal. So
 

1331
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,269
things directly in your terminal. So
it's also going to bootstrap some

1332
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:01,279
it's also going to bootstrap some
 

1333
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,710
it's also going to bootstrap some
additional content here that we'll see

1334
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:02,720
additional content here that we'll see
 

1335
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,630
additional content here that we'll see
shortly in the repository. things like

1336
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:04,640
shortly in the repository. things like
 

1337
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,350
shortly in the repository. things like
the plan, the contract and notice most

1338
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:07,360
the plan, the contract and notice most
 

1339
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,510
the plan, the contract and notice most
importantly that it does consult the

1340
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:09,520
importantly that it does consult the
 

1341
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,269
importantly that it does consult the
constitution like there is then read the

1342
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:11,279
constitution like there is then read the
 

1343
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,350
constitution like there is then read the
spec constitution and plan template. So

1344
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:13,360
spec constitution and plan template. So
 

1345
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,510
spec constitution and plan template. So
constitution is in play the the the set

1346
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
constitution is in play the the the set
 

1347
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,190
constitution is in play the the the set
of non-negotiable things that we talked

1348
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200
of non-negotiable things that we talked
 

1349
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,149
of non-negotiable things that we talked
about earlier is still in play very

1350
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:20,159
about earlier is still in play very
 

1351
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,909
about earlier is still in play very
important. So, we're going to run the

1352
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:21,919
important. So, we're going to run the
 

1353
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,990
important. So, we're going to run the
script. We're going to allow it. YOLO.

1354
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,000
script. We're going to allow it. YOLO.
 

1355
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,430
script. We're going to allow it. YOLO.
Not quite yolo because I still had to

1356
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:25,440
Not quite yolo because I still had to
 

1357
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,590
Not quite yolo because I still had to
approve it for some reason. But, um, we

1358
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:27,600
approve it for some reason. But, um, we
 

1359
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,430
approve it for some reason. But, um, we
see the JSON here, which is the output

1360
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:29,440
see the JSON here, which is the output
 

1361
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,070
see the JSON here, which is the output
of the script because if it's JSON, it's

1362
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,080
of the script because if it's JSON, it's
 

1363
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,909
of the script because if it's JSON, it's
very easy for the LM to parse and

1364
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:33,919
very easy for the LM to parse and
 

1365
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,269
very easy for the LM to parse and
understand it. Notice that it read the

1366
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:35,279
understand it. Notice that it read the
 

1367
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,190
understand it. Notice that it read the
constitution because these are

1368
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
constitution because these are
 

1369
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,870
constitution because these are
non-negotiable principles. We got to

1370
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:38,880
non-negotiable principles. We got to
 

1371
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,990
non-negotiable principles. We got to
respect them no matter what you're

1372
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,000
respect them no matter what you're
 

1373
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,990
respect them no matter what you're
doing. So you have this plan step that's

1374
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,000
doing. So you have this plan step that's
 

1375
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,310
doing. So you have this plan step that's
going to read it and then it's going to

1376
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,320
going to read it and then it's going to
 

1377
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,269
going to read it and then it's going to
go ahead and fill out the actual plan

1378
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,279
go ahead and fill out the actual plan
 

1379
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,750
go ahead and fill out the actual plan
and a bunch of additional metadata

1380
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:49,760
and a bunch of additional metadata
 

1381
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,350
and a bunch of additional metadata
around it that's going to help us

1382
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,360
around it that's going to help us
 

1383
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,149
around it that's going to help us
establish a good project baseline.

1384
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:54,159
establish a good project baseline.
 

1385
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,830
establish a good project baseline.
Notice that because all the stuff also

1386
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:55,840
Notice that because all the stuff also
 

1387
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,110
Notice that because all the stuff also
lives in a dedicated folder. So 001 I am

1388
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,120
lives in a dedicated folder. So 001 I am
 

1389
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,870
lives in a dedicated folder. So 001 I am
building because it just picks up from

1390
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:00,880

1391
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,630
building because it just picks up from
your prompt and it generates a name for

1392
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
your prompt and it generates a name for
 

1393
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,710
your prompt and it generates a name for

1394
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:04,720
the for the feature. All the stuff is
 

1395
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,669
the for the feature. All the stuff is
grouped here. So later on if you decide

1396
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:07,679
grouped here. So later on if you decide
 

1397
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,669
grouped here. So later on if you decide
to rebuild the entire feature like you

1398
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:09,679
to rebuild the entire feature like you
 

1399
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,870
to rebuild the entire feature like you
see what it built and you're like you

1400
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:10,880
see what it built and you're like you
 

1401
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,230
see what it built and you're like you
know what set 5 or sorry set 4 did not

Gemini Flash. You essentially have the

1412
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
Gemini Flash. You essentially have the
 

1413
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,110
Gemini Flash. You essentially have the
spec. You have all your artifacts. You

1414
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,120
spec. You have all your artifacts. You
 

1415
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,430
spec. You have all your artifacts. You
can just delete the source. The spec is

1416
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:29,440
can just delete the source. The spec is
 

1417
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,510
can just delete the source. The spec is
still there and then use a different

1418
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:31,520
still there and then use a different
 

1419
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,190
still there and then use a different
model. So you use the model switcher

1420
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:33,200
model. So you use the model switcher
 

1421
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,830
model. So you use the model switcher
here in the chat and just reimplement

1422
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:35,840
here in the chat and just reimplement
 

1423
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,390
here in the chat and just reimplement
it. That's that's it. You can just

1424
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
it. That's that's it. You can just
 

1425
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,830
it. That's that's it. You can just
rebuild it. You can add additional

1426
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:39,840
rebuild it. You can add additional
 

1427
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,269
rebuild it. You can add additional
requirements. If you see that the logo

1428
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:41,279
requirements. If you see that the logo
 

1429
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,789
requirements. If you see that the logo
is generated the wrong way or it's kind

1430
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:42,799
is generated the wrong way or it's kind
 

1431
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,110
is generated the wrong way or it's kind

source. Once the source is created, of
 

1439
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,350
source. Once the source is created, of
course, you can iterate on it

1440
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:53,360
course, you can iterate on it
 

1441
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,110
course, you can iterate on it
differently. Like you can add another

differently. Like you can add another
 

1443
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,789

spec for another feature, for another
 

1445

component. you the the one spec that we
 

1447
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,950
component. you the the one spec that we
have here in this what we refer to as

1448
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:00,960
have here in this what we refer to as
 

1449
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,390

00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:02,400
green field project because we're
 

1451
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,149
green field project because we're
creating a new thing is just that is

1452
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:06,159
creating a new thing is just that is
 

1453
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,590
creating a new thing is just that is
just the bootstrap of the project. You

1454
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,600
just the bootstrap of the project. You
 

1455
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,149
just the bootstrap of the project. You
can do this exact same thing for any

1456
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:10,159
can do this exact same thing for any
 

1457
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,070
can do this exact same thing for any
other features. If you want to add

1458
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,080
other features. If you want to add
 

1459
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,470
other features. If you want to add
support for a Spotify player for example

1460
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:14,480
support for a Spotify player for example
 

1461
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,149
support for a Spotify player for example
in your podcast page just use specify to

1462
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:18,159
in your podcast page just use specify to
 

1463
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,149
in your podcast page just use specify to
essentially create a new feature right

1464
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:20,159
essentially create a new feature right
 

1465
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,029
essentially create a new feature right
like that's kind of it. you use plan to

1466
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:23,039
like that's kind of it. you use plan to
 

1467
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,470
like that's kind of it. you use plan to
go and create another set of technical

1468
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:24,480
go and create another set of technical
 

1469
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,630
go and create another set of technical
details for that feature because that's

1470
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:26,640
details for that feature because that's
 

1471
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,830
details for that feature because that's
what it's going to do. It's going to

1472
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:27,840
what it's going to do. It's going to
 

1473
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,630
what it's going to do. It's going to
create new subfolders that you can then

1474
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:30,640
create new subfolders that you can then
 

1475
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,710
create new subfolders that you can then
iterate on. So here we're going to wait

1476
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:32,720
iterate on. So here we're going to wait
 

1477
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,669
iterate on. So here we're going to wait
a little bit for GPD5 to go and think

1478
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:35,679
a little bit for GPD5 to go and think
 

1479
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:36,870
a little bit for GPD5 to go and think
through. But notice that it actually

1480
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:36,880
through. But notice that it actually
 

1481
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,149
through. But notice that it actually
started thinking about things like

1482
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:38,159
started thinking about things like
 

1483
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,590
started thinking about things like
contracts because it's going to look at

1484
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:39,600
contracts because it's going to look at
 

1485
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,029
contracts because it's going to look at
data contracts that exist within the

1486
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:41,039
data contracts that exist within the
 

1487
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,029
data contracts that exist within the
pages. But uh I'm not going to disturb

1488
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:43,039
pages. But uh I'm not going to disturb
 

1489
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,510
pages. But uh I'm not going to disturb
it. I'm going to let it think and do its

1490
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:45,520
it. I'm going to let it think and do its
 

1491
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,230
it. I'm going to let it think and do its
job. And we're going to get back here

1492
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:48,240
job. And we're going to get back here
 

1493
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,230
job. And we're going to get back here
once we see the actual outcome of the

1494
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,240
once we see the actual outcome of the
 

1495
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,789
once we see the actual outcome of the
process.

1496

We see plan. I'm going to keep all of

1508
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:12,480
We see plan. I'm going to keep all of
 

1509
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,149
We see plan. I'm going to keep all of
the changes. It created a bunch of other

1510
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,159
the changes. It created a bunch of other
 

1511
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,710
the changes. It created a bunch of other
metadata here. So we can scroll through

1512
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:16,720
metadata here. So we can scroll through
 

1513
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,549
metadata here. So we can scroll through
the plan. We can minimize the terminal

1514
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:18,559
the plan. We can minimize the terminal
 

1515
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,669
the plan. We can minimize the terminal
just a little bit. We see that it has an

1516
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:21,679
just a little bit. We see that it has an
 

1517
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,630
just a little bit. We see that it has an
execution flow for the plan. Great. Uh

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,789
this. Uh keep in mind that if I wanted
for example to host things on say

1544
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:52,799
for example to host things on say
 

1545
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,909
for example to host things on say
Cloudflare or Azure, I can specify that

1546
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:55,919
Cloudflare or Azure, I can specify that
 

1547
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,990
Cloudflare or Azure, I can specify that
in the constitution. I can say that

1548
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,000
in the constitution. I can say that
 

1549
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,070
in the constitution. I can say that
everything that you do has to be

1550
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,080
everything that you do has to be
 

1551
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,549
everything that you do has to be
oriented for Cloudflare or Azure or

1552
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:02,559
oriented for Cloudflare or Azure or
 

1553
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,710
oriented for Cloudflare or Azure or
anything any any other provider whatever

1554
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:04,720
anything any any other provider whatever
 

1555
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,789
anything any any other provider whatever
you want uh or any other technical

1556
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:06,799
you want uh or any other technical
 

1557
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,510
you want uh or any other technical
requirements by the way. So um we have

1558
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:09,520
requirements by the way. So um we have
 

1559
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,269
requirements by the way. So um we have
the project types some constitution

1560
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:11,279
the project types some constitution
 

1561
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,510
the project types some constitution
checks and there's a gate that again it

1562
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:13,520
checks and there's a gate that again it
 

1563
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,470
checks and there's a gate that again it
must pass the constitutional check it

1564
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:16,480
must pass the constitutional check it
 

1565
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,549
must pass the constitutional check it
must pass the requirements that we have

1566
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:18,559
must pass the requirements that we have
 

1567
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,990
must pass the requirements that we have
established for things like use

1568
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,000

00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,360
way copilot in this case did not do the
 

1583
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,269
way copilot in this case did not do the
actual research it used its training

1584
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:37,279
actual research it used its training

00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:42,960
file. Other agents like copilot, sorry,

like quad code can actually go and do

1590
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:45,840
like quad code can actually go and do
 

1591
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,990
like quad code can actually go and do
research. So this you you'd get the the

1592
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,000
research. So this you you'd get the the
 

1593
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,070
research. So this you you'd get the the
freshest information from the internet.

1594
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,080
freshest information from the internet.
 

1595
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,909
freshest information from the internet.
Um but it actually made some pretty good

1596
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:51,919
Um but it actually made some pretty good
 

1597
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,070
Um but it actually made some pretty good
assumptions here. So we have the

1598
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,080
assumptions here. So we have the
 

1599
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,470
assumptions here. So we have the
context, we have some of the outline on

1600
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:56,480
context, we have some of the outline on
 

1601
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,950
context, we have some of the outline on
the phases. Uh and now look, we're

1602
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:58,960
the phases. Uh and now look, we're
 

1603
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,110
the phases. Uh and now look, we're
missing the task generated. We're going

1604
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,120
missing the task generated. We're going
 

1605
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,190
missing the task generated. We're going
to run the task command now. Uh but

1606
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,200
to run the task command now. Uh but
 

1607
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,230
to run the task command now. Uh but
before we do that, let's take a look

1608
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:04,240
before we do that, let's take a look
 

1609
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,990
before we do that, let's take a look
here. So there is a research file like I

1610
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,000
here. So there is a research file like I
 

1611
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,310
here. So there is a research file like I
mentioned. So it looked through its

1612
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,320
mentioned. So it looked through its
 

1613
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,830
mentioned. So it looked through its
training data because all this is

1614
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:09,840
training data because all this is
 

1615
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,350
training data because all this is
generated by the LLM basically, right?

1616
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,360
generated by the LLM basically, right?
 

1617
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,870
generated by the LLM basically, right?
Like it's all whatever is embedded in

1618
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:12,880
Like it's all whatever is embedded in
 

1619
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,230
Like it's all whatever is embedded in
the training data. That's what it's used

1620
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:14,240
the training data. That's what it's used
 

1621
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,669
the training data. That's what it's used
for its inspiration instead of actually

1622
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:15,679
for its inspiration instead of actually
 

1623
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,310
for its inspiration instead of actually
going out into the web. Uh we can use

1624
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:18,320
going out into the web. Uh we can use
 

1625
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,549
going out into the web. Uh we can use
something like the beast mode from our

1626
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:20,559
something like the beast mode from our
 

1627
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,029
something like the beast mode from our
good friend Burke Holland uh to force it

1628
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:23,039
good friend Burke Holland uh to force it
 

1629
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,190
good friend Burke Holland uh to force it
to do certain things, but I just use

1630
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
to do certain things, but I just use
 

1631
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,029
to do certain things, but I just use
standard agent mode here because I did

1632
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:27,039
standard agent mode here because I did
 

1633
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,590
standard agent mode here because I did
not use custom modes now which which is

1634
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:29,600
not use custom modes now which which is
 

1635
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,830
not use custom modes now which which is
fine for our prototype. It's okay. So we

1636
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:31,840
fine for our prototype. It's okay. So we
 

1637
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,430
fine for our prototype. It's okay. So we
have this. We have some data model

1638
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:33,440
have this. We have some data model
 

1639
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,269
have this. We have some data model
outline for you know fields for an

1640
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:35,279
outline for you know fields for an
 

1641
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,870
outline for you know fields for an
episode which is again great. It has the

1642
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:36,880
episode which is again great. It has the
 

1643
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,110
episode which is again great. It has the
context. We're building a podcast

1644
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,120
context. We're building a podcast
 

1645
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,590
context. We're building a podcast
website some details about the site some

1646
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:41,600
website some details about the site some
 

1647
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,549
website some details about the site some
validation rules derived views. Um we

1648
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:44,559
validation rules derived views. Um we
 

1649
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,470
validation rules derived views. Um we
still have our spec. We have our quick

1650
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:46,480
still have our spec. We have our quick
 

1651
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,669
still have our spec. We have our quick
start that gives some idea of what the

1652
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:49,679
start that gives some idea of what the
 

1653
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,070
start that gives some idea of what the
site is about and the prerequisites that

1654
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,080
site is about and the prerequisites that
 

1655
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,510
site is about and the prerequisites that
are required for the site to actually

1656
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:53,520
are required for the site to actually
 

1657
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,070
are required for the site to actually
run. Again super super nice to have this

1658
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,080
run. Again super super nice to have this
 

1659
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,310
run. Again super super nice to have this
in one place. the spec and all the

1660
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,320
in one place. the spec and all the
 

1661
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,029
in one place. the spec and all the
artifacts become that piece of

1662
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:01,039
artifacts become that piece of
 

1663
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,870
artifacts become that piece of
executable context that you can pass to

1664
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:02,880
executable context that you can pass to
 

1665
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,029
executable context that you can pass to
your team and have them work on it. But

1666
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,039
your team and have them work on it. But
 

1667
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,070
your team and have them work on it. But
uh we have the plan u now as the plan

1668
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,080
uh we have the plan u now as the plan
 

1669
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,909
uh we have the plan u now as the plan
says we got to jump to our task. So we

1670
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:09,919
says we got to jump to our task. So we
 

1671
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:17,510
says we got to jump to our task. So we
can use tasks and say break this down.

1672
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:17,520

 

1673
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,750

Right? So once again, it's going to run

1674
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:19,760
Right? So once again, it's going to run
 

1675
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,029
Right? So once again, it's going to run
some helper scripts that are going to

1676
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:21,039
some helper scripts that are going to
 

1677
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,750
some helper scripts that are going to
guide it through and it's going to break

1678
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:23,760
guide it through and it's going to break
 

1679
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,830
guide it through and it's going to break
the work down into manageable chunks

1680
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:25,840
the work down into manageable chunks
 

1681
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,630
the work down into manageable chunks
that the agent can tackle one by one

1682
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:28,640
that the agent can tackle one by one
 

1683
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,230
that the agent can tackle one by one
because that is super nice. That is kind

1684
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:32,240
because that is super nice. That is kind
 

1685
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,549
because that is super nice. That is kind
of the ability of seeing exactly what it

1686
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:34,559
of the ability of seeing exactly what it
 

1687
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,029
of the ability of seeing exactly what it
needs to do instead of it assuming that

1688
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:37,039
needs to do instead of it assuming that
 

1689
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,509
needs to do instead of it assuming that
it needs to partake in certain actions.

1690
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:39,519
it needs to partake in certain actions.
 

1691
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,350
it needs to partake in certain actions.
Right? So if I want to build the

1692
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,360
Right? So if I want to build the
 

1693
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,509
Right? So if I want to build the
testdriven developmentbased approach

1694
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:43,519
testdriven developmentbased approach
 

1695
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,669
testdriven developmentbased approach
where I want to have tests first, all

1696
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:45,679
where I want to have tests first, all
 

1697
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,909
where I want to have tests first, all
that stuff, you know, can be broken down

1698
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:47,919
that stuff, you know, can be broken down
 

1699
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,430
that stuff, you know, can be broken down
into individual tasks. It's going to do

1700
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:49,440
into individual tasks. It's going to do
 

1701
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,630
into individual tasks. It's going to do
that first. It's going to make sure the

1702
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:50,640
that first. It's going to make sure the
 

1703
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,389
that first. It's going to make sure the
tests are passing and then jump to

1704
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:52,399
tests are passing and then jump to
 

1705
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,669
tests are passing and then jump to
implementation of the data model and so

1706
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:53,679
implementation of the data model and so
 

1707
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,230
implementation of the data model and so
on so forth. So uh we're going to uh

1708
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:56,240
on so forth. So uh we're going to uh
 

1709
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,230
on so forth. So uh we're going to uh
have it do some more work here.

1710
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:00,240
have it do some more work here.
 

1711
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,230
have it do some more work here.
Going to check task prerequisites. All

1712
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:02,240
Going to check task prerequisites. All
 

1713
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,750
Going to check task prerequisites. All
right. So it's going to use a test

1714
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:03,760
right. So it's going to use a test
 

1715
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,509
right. So it's going to use a test
template.

1716
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:05,519
template.
 

1717
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,230
template.
Going to set things up for us. And we're

1718

Going to set things up for us. And we're
 

1719
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,710

1721
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,710
going to get another tasks.md
file, another markdown file in our

1722
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:12,720
file, another markdown file in our
 

1723
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,590
file, another markdown file in our
folder that we can use to actually

1724
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:15,600
folder that we can use to actually
 

1725
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,870
folder that we can use to actually
browse through the task. Right now,

1726
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:16,880
browse through the task. Right now,
 

1727
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,470

because it's all marked down, it's all
 

1729

the markdown and start tinkering with it
 

1739
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,310
the markdown and start tinkering with it
because it's so easily editable. It

Think a little bit and create our task

1772
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:05,519
Think a little bit and create our task
 

1773
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,630
Think a little bit and create our task
list.

1774
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:10,640

 

1775
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,669

Look at that. We have our task file. So,

1776
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:13,679
Look at that. We have our task file. So,
 

1777
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,669
Look at that. We have our task file. So,
if I go here again, we're going to keep

1778
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:15,679
if I go here again, we're going to keep
 

1779
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,310
if I go here again, we're going to keep
all the changes as is. And we see a

1780
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:18,320
all the changes as is. And we see a
 

1781
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,990
all the changes as is. And we see a
bunch of t Let's Let's actually reduce

1782
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,000
bunch of t Let's Let's actually reduce
 

1783
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,070
bunch of t Let's Let's actually reduce
the size here, right? So, you can

1784
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,080
the size here, right? So, you can
 

1785
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,389
the size here, right? So, you can
actually see a little bit. We're going

1786
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:24,399
actually see a little bit. We're going
 

1787
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,789
actually see a little bit. We're going
to reduce the size of this as well. Um,

1788
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:26,799
to reduce the size of this as well. Um,
 

1789
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,789
to reduce the size of this as well. Um,
and we see the the the sections here,

1790
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:28,799
and we see the the the sections here,
 

1791
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,350
and we see the the the sections here,
right? like it it just chunk this into

1792
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:31,360
right? like it it just chunk this into
 

1793
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,750
right? like it it just chunk this into
individual phases. We have setup

1794
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:33,760
individual phases. We have setup
 

1795
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,310
individual phases. We have setup
initialize next.js app skeleton. Yep.

1796
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:36,320
initialize next.js app skeleton. Yep.
 

1797
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,470
initialize next.js app skeleton. Yep.
Yep. That sounds good. Test first must

1798
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:38,480
Yep. That sounds good. Test first must
 

1799
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,470
Yep. That sounds good. Test first must
fail before 33. All right. Yeah, because

1800
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:40,480
fail before 33. All right. Yeah, because
 

1801
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,990
fail before 33. All right. Yeah, because
we do want to use test-driven

1802
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,000
we do want to use test-driven
 

1803
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,710
we do want to use test-driven
development here. Uh, okay, that sounds

1804
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:44,720
development here. Uh, okay, that sounds
 

1805
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,710
development here. Uh, okay, that sounds
good. Core implementation only after

1806
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:46,720
good. Core implementation only after
 

1807
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,149
good. Core implementation only after
tests are failing, right? Because we're

1808
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:48,159
tests are failing, right? Because we're
 

1809
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,549
tests are failing, right? Because we're
setting up the test first. Makes sense.

1810
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:50,559
setting up the test first. Makes sense.
 

1811
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,590
setting up the test first. Makes sense.

the kind of the spec scaffolding for us,
 

1841
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,270
the kind of the spec scaffolding for us,
but for creative output, Sonnet 4 is

still unbeatable to me. So, I'm just
 

1845
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,389
still unbeatable to me. So, I'm just
going to say this and say implement

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,790
going to say this and say implement
the tasks for this project

1848
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:36,800
the tasks for this project
 

1849
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,990
the tasks for this project
and update the task list as you go.

1850
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,000
and update the task list as you go.
 

1851
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,829
and update the task list as you go.
And

1852
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:43,839
And
 

1853
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,510
And
now we're going to let the agent run

1854
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:45,520
now we're going to let the agent run
 

1855
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,200
now we're going to let the agent run
wild and go and implement our website.

1856
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:51,210
wild and go and implement our website.
 

1857
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:58,060
wild and go and implement our website.

Tada. Looks like it did it. It It
finished the work. It did the things

1882
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,040
finished the work. It did the things
 

1883
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,589
finished the work. It did the things
that it was supposed to do. Now, I have

1884
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:33,599
that it was supposed to do. Now, I have
 

1885
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,510
that it was supposed to do. Now, I have
not seen the output. This is going to be

1886
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:35,520
not seen the output. This is going to be
 

1887
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,349
not seen the output. This is going to be
a surprise. So, let's keep all the

1888
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:37,359
a surprise. So, let's keep all the
 

1889
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,349
a surprise. So, let's keep all the
changes. Let's make sure that we keep

1890
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:39,359
changes. Let's make sure that we keep
 

1891
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,150
changes. Let's make sure that we keep
it. It updated all the tasks. It failed

1892
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,160
it. It updated all the tasks. It failed
 

1893
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,829
it. It updated all the tasks. It failed
on some Lighthouse test, but that is

1894
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:43,839
on some Lighthouse test, but that is
 

1895
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,150
on some Lighthouse test, but that is
because I don't have Chrome installed.

1896
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:46,160
because I don't have Chrome installed.
 

1897
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,349
because I don't have Chrome installed.
But we can actually run npm

1898
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:49,359
But we can actually run npm
 

1899
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:54,390
But we can actually run npm
uh I like to run num npm run build.

1900
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:54,400
uh I like to run num npm run build.
 

1901
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,230
uh I like to run num npm run build.
Let's build our static site

1902
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,240
Let's build our static site
 

1903
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,589
Let's build our static site
and then we're going to run npm npm

1904
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:01,599
and then we're going to run npm npm
 

1905
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,310
and then we're going to run npm npm
rundev to actually see it in action once

1906
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:04,320
rundev to actually see it in action once
 

1907
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,470
rundev to actually see it in action once
it actually builds. So we'll see we'll

1908
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:06,480
it actually builds. So we'll see we'll
 

1909
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,349
it actually builds. So we'll see we'll
see what it looks like.

1910
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:09,359
see what it looks like.
 

1911
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,230
see what it looks like.
All right.

1912
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,240
All right.
 

1913
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,310

Selecting build traces being the most
 

1915
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,470

1917
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,910

All right. And then npm run

All right. And then npm run
 

1919
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,150

All right. Great. Episodes. Let's take a

1944
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:58,880
All right. Great. Episodes. Let's take a
 

1945
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,750
All right. Great. Episodes. Let's take a
look here. We have individual podcast

1946
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:01,760
look here. We have individual podcast
 

1947
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,390
look here. We have individual podcast
episodes with links to the podcast

1948
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:04,400
episodes with links to the podcast
 

1949
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,270
episodes with links to the podcast
platform. And keep in mind that in this

1950
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:07,280
platform. And keep in mind that in this
 

1951
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,990
platform. And keep in mind that in this
context, what I can also do is if I plug

1952
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:10,000
context, what I can also do is if I plug
 

1953
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,589
context, what I can also do is if I plug
in MCP tools like Figma MCP, I can link

1954
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:13,599
in MCP tools like Figma MCP, I can link
 

1955
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,150
in MCP tools like Figma MCP, I can link
to actual design. So I can actually get

1956
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,160
to actual design. So I can actually get
 

1957
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,950
to actual design. So I can actually get
it to build things that fit the design

1958
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:18,960
it to build things that fit the design
 

1959
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,790
it to build things that fit the design
system of my organization. So I don't

1960
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:20,800
system of my organization. So I don't
 

1961
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,390
system of my organization. So I don't
have to randomly assume that it's going

1962
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:22,400
have to randomly assume that it's going
 

1963
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,750
have to randomly assume that it's going
to build the right thing. So this is

1964
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:23,760
to build the right thing. So this is
 

1965
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,430
to build the right thing. So this is
kind of nice. Like it did create all

1966
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:25,440
kind of nice. Like it did create all
 

1967
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,990
kind of nice. Like it did create all
this stuff. Now you might actually ask

1968
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,000
this stuff. Now you might actually ask
 

1969
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,750
this stuff. Now you might actually ask
yourselves like, well, is is this really

1970
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:29,760
yourselves like, well, is is this really
 

1971
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,349
yourselves like, well, is is this really
better than vibe coding? Like I could

1972
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:31,359
better than vibe coding? Like I could
 

1973
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,030
better than vibe coding? Like I could
have vibe coded this entire pod side,

1974
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,040
have vibe coded this entire pod side,
 

1975
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,069
have vibe coded this entire pod side,
right? But the thing is is that now that

1976
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:36,079
right? But the thing is is that now that
 

1977
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,670
right? But the thing is is that now that
I have the spec, now that I have the

1978
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:37,680
I have the spec, now that I have the
 

1979
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,750
I have the spec, now that I have the
artifacts here in my spec

1980
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:39,760
artifacts here in my spec
 

1981
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,230
artifacts here in my spec
implementation, I can easily customize

1982
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:42,240
implementation, I can easily customize
 

1983
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,870
implementation, I can easily customize
it. I can now tweak it. I can add things

1984
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:44,880
it. I can now tweak it. I can add things
 

1985
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,870
it. I can now tweak it. I can add things
like I want to make sure that the color

1986
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:46,880
like I want to make sure that the color
 

1987
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,990
like I want to make sure that the color
is certain way. I want to make sure that

1988
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:48,000
is certain way. I want to make sure that
 

1989
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,430
is certain way. I want to make sure that
a specific design decision is being

1990
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:49,440
a specific design decision is being
 

1991
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,190
a specific design decision is being
made. And that makes it easier for me to

1992
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:51,200
made. And that makes it easier for me to
 

1993
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,589
made. And that makes it easier for me to
then reimplement and rebuild things and

1994
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:53,599
then reimplement and rebuild things and
 

1995
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,069
then reimplement and rebuild things and
additively add features in a structured

1996
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:56,079
additively add features in a structured
 

1997
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,349
additively add features in a structured
way because that then can be used as

1998
00:38:59,349 --> 00:38:59,359
way because that then can be used as
 

1999
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,910
way because that then can be used as
context. So something that my colleague

2000
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:01,920
context. So something that my colleague
 

2001
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,750
context. So something that my colleague
and friend John Lamb is working on is

2002
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:03,760
and friend John Lamb is working on is
 

2003
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,510
and friend John Lamb is working on is
optimizing some of these context

2004
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:05,520
optimizing some of these context
 

2005
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,270
optimizing some of these context
acquisition strategies. So that's going

2006
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:07,280
acquisition strategies. So that's going
 

2007
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,710
acquisition strategies. So that's going
to change in the future. But you can

2008
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:08,720
to change in the future. But you can
 

2009
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,630
to change in the future. But you can
imagine that as I have more of this

2010
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:10,640
imagine that as I have more of this
 

2011
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,270
imagine that as I have more of this
context in the memory of the system that

2012
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:13,280
context in the memory of the system that
 

2013
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,349
context in the memory of the system that
is being built, it actually makes it

2014
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:15,359
is being built, it actually makes it
 

2015
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,150
is being built, it actually makes it
easier to build consistent software. So

2016
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,160
easier to build consistent software. So
 

2017
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,150
easier to build consistent software. So
uh hopefully this is a great intro for

2018
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,160
uh hopefully this is a great intro for
 

2019
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,230
uh hopefully this is a great intro for
you to see like how spectra works, what

2020
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:22,240
you to see like how spectra works, what
 

2021
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,750
you to see like how spectra works, what
are the artifacts and how it produces

2022
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:23,760
are the artifacts and how it produces
 

2023
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,870
are the artifacts and how it produces
them and how you can then tweak them. I

2024
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:26,880
them and how you can then tweak them. I
 

2025
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,790
them and how you can then tweak them. I
really really hope that you go to spec

2026
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:28,800
really really hope that you go to spec
 

2027
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,270
really really hope that you go to spec
kit. You try it out. You get it running

2028
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:31,280
kit. You try it out. You get it running
 

2029
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,349
kit. You try it out. You get it running
on your box. You see what works and what

2030
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:33,359
on your box. You see what works and what
 

2031
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,790
on your box. You see what works and what
doesn't, especially as you start

2032
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:34,800
doesn't, especially as you start
 

2033
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,550
doesn't, especially as you start
compounding many many different features

2034
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:36,560
compounding many many different features
 

2035
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,190
compounding many many different features
and bug fixes and all these things for

2036
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:39,200
and bug fixes and all these things for
 

2037
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,430
and bug fixes and all these things for
your projects. Let me know. Go to

2038
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:41,440
your projects. Let me know. Go to
 

2039
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,510
your projects. Let me know. Go to
github.com/github/spec-kit.

2040
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:45,520

 

2041
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,470

Download it. Use it. Tell me what's

2042
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:48,480
Download it. Use it. Tell me what's
 

2043
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,710
Download it. Use it. Tell me what's
wrong. And then I will see you in the

2044
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:50,720
wrong. And then I will see you in the
 

2045
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,230
wrong. And then I will see you in the
next video where we're going to talk

2046
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:52,240
next video where we're going to talk
 

2047
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,790
next video where we're going to talk
about more complex things that are also

2048
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:54,800
about more complex things that are also
 

2049
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,310
about more complex things that are also
being accomplished with the help of

2050
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:56,320
being accomplished with the help of
 

2051
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,069
being accomplished with the help of
specd driven development. I hope you

2052
00:39:58,069 --> 00:39:58,079
specd driven development. I hope you
 

2053
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,079
specd driven development. I hope you
enjoy this. I'll see you in the next
